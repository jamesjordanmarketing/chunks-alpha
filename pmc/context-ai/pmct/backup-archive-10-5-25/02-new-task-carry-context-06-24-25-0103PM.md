# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 06-24-25-0103PM
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**Task T-2.3.5: Accessibility and Reduced Motion Documentation Implementation**

You are tasked with implementing T-2.3.5: Accessibility and Reduced Motion Documentation for the Next.js 14 design system animations. This task builds directly upon the successful completion of T-2.3.4: Animation Timing and Easing Function Documentation, which created comprehensive timing specifications that now require accessibility integration.

**What is being worked on**: Implementation of accessibility-focused animation documentation that provides reduced motion alternatives, establishes accessibility best practices, documents motion preference detection techniques, and creates methods for assessing animation accessibility impact.

**Why it is being worked on**: T-2.3.4 successfully established comprehensive animation timing documentation (5 files, 112.2KB total) with 100% legacy reference accuracy. However, extensive testing revealed that while timing specifications are complete, accessibility considerations for users with motion sensitivities are not adequately addressed. T-2.3.5 fills this critical gap by ensuring all animation implementations can be made accessible and respect user motion preferences.

**Current state of implementation**: T-2.3.5 has not been started. The task specifications are defined in `pmc/core/active-task.md` with clear acceptance criteria and implementation phases. The task will be implemented in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/accessibility/` following the proven documentation patterns established by T-2.3.4.

**Critical context needed for continuation**: 
- T-2.3.4 established timing patterns that must be referenced for accessibility alternatives
- Legacy animation implementations in `aplio-legacy/components/animations/FadeUpAnimation.jsx` (lines 6-11) contain existing reduced motion patterns that must be documented
- The implementation must achieve WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance standards
- Documentation structure should follow T-2.3.4's successful 5-file pattern for consistency

### Current Active Action 

**Task ID**: T-2.3.5
**Title**: Accessibility and Reduced Motion Documentation
**Current Phase**: Preparation (not started)
**Active Element**: None - awaiting implementation agent assignment
**Last Recorded Action**: Task initialized on 06/24/2025, 01:03:22 PM

### Bugs & Challenges in the Current Task

**T-2.3.4 Dark Mode Coverage Issue (RESOLVED but informative for T-2.3.5)**:
- **Issue**: T-2.3.4 testing revealed only 2 dark mode specifications (3% of 60+ requirement)
- **Status**: Addressed with comprehensive fix specification moved to future implementation
- **Impact on T-2.3.5**: Accessibility documentation must include dark mode considerations from the start
- **Mitigation**: T-2.3.5 should integrate dark mode accessibility patterns as core requirement, not afterthought

### Next Steps 

1. **T-2.3.5-PREP-1**: Analyze reduced motion implementations in legacy codebase (`aplio-legacy/components/animations/FadeUpAnimation.jsx:6-11`) to understand existing patterns
2. **T-2.3.5-PREP-2**: Research animation accessibility best practices and WCAG 2.1 Level AA requirements for motion-based content
3. **T-2.3.5-PREP-3**: Study motion preference detection techniques using `prefers-reduced-motion` media query and JavaScript APIs
4. **T-2.3.5-PREP-4**: Research methods for assessing animation accessibility impact across different user needs and assistive technologies
5. **T-2.3.5-IMP-1**: Begin implementation phase with reduced motion alternatives documentation

### Important Dependencies

**T-2.3.4 Animation Timing Documentation (COMPLETED)**:
- **Dependency**: All 5 timing documentation files in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/timing/`
- **Status**: Successfully implemented with 100% legacy reference accuracy
- **Impact**: T-2.3.5 accessibility alternatives must reference and build upon established timing patterns

**Legacy Animation Components (CRITICAL REFERENCE)**:
- **Dependency**: `aplio-legacy/components/animations/FadeUpAnimation.jsx` lines 6-11
- **Status**: Contains existing reduced motion implementations that must be documented
- **Impact**: Primary source for understanding current accessibility patterns in the legacy system

**WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance (REQUIREMENT)**:
- **Dependency**: Accessibility standards for motion-based content
- **Status**: Must be researched and implemented as core requirement
- **Impact**: All documentation and examples must meet these standards

### Important Files

1. **`pmc/core/active-task.md`** - Complete T-2.3.5 task specifications with acceptance criteria and implementation phases
2. **`aplio-legacy/components/animations/FadeUpAnimation.jsx`** (lines 6-11) - Legacy reduced motion implementations for reference
3. **`aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/timing/`** - T-2.3.4 timing documentation that accessibility alternatives must reference
4. **`aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/accessibility/`** - Target implementation directory for T-2.3.5 (to be created)
5. **`aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-2-3/T-2.3.5/`** - Testing directory for T-2.3.5 validation

### Important Scripts, Markdown Files, and Specifications

**PMC Command Scripts (run from pmc directory)**:
- **`node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.3.5 "PREP" "complete"`** - Mark preparation phase complete
- **`node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.3.5 "IMP" "complete"`** - Mark implementation phase complete

- **`pmc/core/previous-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced.md`** - Comprehensive testing protocol that achieved T-2.3.4 validation

### Recent Development Context

**Last Milestone**: T-2.3.4 Animation Timing and Easing Function Documentation completed successfully with comprehensive testing validation including 100% legacy reference accuracy, complete TypeScript integration, and WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

**Key Outcomes**: 
- 5 comprehensive documentation files created (112.2KB total) establishing timing standards
- 100% legacy reference accuracy achieved for all animation.js and tailwind.config.js values
- Complete TypeScript strict mode compliance with production-ready code examples
- Accessibility compliance validated but revealed need for dedicated accessibility documentation

**Relevant Learnings**: 
- T-2.3.4's 5-file documentation structure proved highly effective and should be replicated for T-2.3.5
- Legacy reference accuracy is critical - any deviation from legacy patterns causes implementation failure
- Dark mode considerations must be integrated from the start, not added as afterthought
- Comprehensive testing protocols are essential for production-ready documentation

**Technical Context**: 
- Animation timing patterns established in `design-system/docs/animations/timing/` provide foundation for accessibility alternatives
- Legacy reduced motion patterns in `FadeUpAnimation.jsx` lines 6-11 contain existing accessibility implementations
- Next.js 14 App Router architecture requires specific accessibility integration patterns
- TypeScript strict mode compliance is mandatory for all code examples

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The second context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)
- The third context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v3.js` (created when the second got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
