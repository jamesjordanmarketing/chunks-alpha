**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses the transition from **COMPLETED** T-3.1.4 Button Component Testing and Documentation to the implementation of **T-3.2.1 Accordion Component Structure and Types**. The previous task established comprehensive testing patterns and design system integration approaches that inform the next implementation.

## Active Development Focus

### T-3.2.1 Accordion Component Structure and Types Implementation

**Current Focus**: Implement the foundational structure and type definitions for the Accordion component system in the molecules layer of the design system.

**What is being worked on**: 
- Creating comprehensive directory structure for Accordion components at `aplio-modern-1/components/design-system/molecules/Accordion/`
- Defining TypeScript interfaces for Accordion container and AccordionItem components
- Establishing optimized server/client component boundaries for Next.js 14 App Router

**Why it is being worked on**:
- Accordion components are critical interactive elements for the Home-4 template implementation
- Need to establish proper composite component architecture following design system patterns
- Requirements include support for single and multiple open accordion variants
- Must enable proper composition of accordion items with full accessibility support

**Current state of implementation**: 
- **Not started** - Ready to begin T-3.2.1 implementation

## Critical Implementation Context

### Design System Architecture Insights from T-3.1.4
**Component Organization**: The Button component implementation established successful patterns:
- **Main component file**: `index.tsx` with proper React.memo optimization
- **Type definitions**: Comprehensive `Component.types.ts` with full variant support
- **Documentation**: Complete `README.md` with usage examples and API reference
- **Testing structure**: Separate test files for unit, accessibility, and performance testing

**TypeScript Integration**: T-3.1.4 demonstrated:
- **Comprehensive interfaces** supporting all component variants and states
- **Generic type parameters** for flexible component composition
- **Strict type safety** without any 'any' types
- **Component prop merging** utilities for convenience props vs. advanced configuration

### Testing Framework Established in T-3.1.4
**Infrastructure Ready**: 
- **Jest configuration** optimized for Next.js 14 and TypeScript
- **React Testing Library** setup with custom render utilities
- **Jest-Axe** configured for accessibility testing
- **Coverage reporting** configured to target 90% minimum

**Testing Patterns Proven**:
- **Comprehensive unit testing** covering all variants, states, and functionality
- **Accessibility testing** with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance validation
- **Performance testing** ensuring React.memo optimization
- **Documentation testing** validating all examples work correctly

## Existing Implementation Instructions Adaptations

### Enhanced Patterns from T-3.1.4 Success
**You must apply** the following proven patterns from T-3.1.4 to T-3.2.1:

1. **Component Structure Pattern**:
   - Create comprehensive type definitions in `Accordion.types.ts`
   - Implement main component in `index.tsx` with React.memo optimization
   - Provide complete documentation in `README.md` with usage examples
   - Establish proper server/client component boundaries

2. **TypeScript Excellence Pattern**:
   - Define comprehensive interfaces supporting all accordion variants
   - Include convenience props alongside advanced configuration options
   - Maintain strict type safety without any 'any' types
   - Support both single and multiple open accordion variants as specified

3. **Testing Excellence Pattern**:
   - Create comprehensive test files for unit, accessibility, and performance testing
   - Target 90% minimum test coverage with comprehensive variant testing
   - Implement WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance testing
   - Validate all documentation examples work correctly

### DSAP Compliance Requirements Enhanced
Based on T-3.1.4 success, **you must enhance** DSAP compliance for accordion components:
- **Search accordion-specific documentation** in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/interactive/accordion/`
- **Apply state transition animations** following established animation patterns
- **Implement keyboard navigation** following accessibility guidelines
- **Document component decisions** when design system documentation is missing

## Modified Implementation Approaches

### Composite Component Architecture
**T-3.2.1 requires** composite component patterns different from atomic Button component:
- **Accordion container** manages state for single/multiple open variants
- **AccordionItem components** handle individual item state and interactions
- **Proper composition** enables flexible accordion configurations
- **Server/client optimization** minimizes JavaScript for static content

### State Management Considerations
**Enhance state management** beyond T-3.1.4 atomic component patterns:
- **Container-level state** for managing open/closed accordion items
- **Flexible configuration** supporting controlled and uncontrolled modes
- **Performance optimization** preventing unnecessary re-renders across items
- **Accessibility state** management for screen readers and keyboard navigation

## Eliminated Requirements

**The following T-3.1.4 requirements do not apply** to T-3.2.1:
❌ **Comprehensive testing implementation** - T-3.2.1 focuses on structure and types only
❌ **Documentation creation** - T-3.2.1 is structure/types, documentation comes in later tasks
❌ **Performance testing implementation** - Testing will be handled in subsequent accordion tasks
❌ **Visual regression testing** - No visual implementation in T-3.2.1 structure task

## Additional Implementation Needs

### Composite Component Specific Requirements
**Fresh requirements** for T-3.2.1 not present in atomic Button component:
1. **Component composition architecture** supporting flexible accordion configurations
2. **State management patterns** for container and item relationships
3. **Multiple variant support** for single vs. multiple open accordion behavior
4. **Server/client boundary optimization** for composite component performance

### Legacy Integration Analysis
**Additional analysis required** for accordion-specific patterns:
1. **CustomFAQ.jsx analysis** for overall accordion container structure and behavior
2. **FaqItem.jsx analysis** for individual accordion item patterns and interactions
3. **State management extraction** from legacy implementation for modern React patterns
4. **Interaction pattern analysis** for keyboard navigation and accessibility support
