## Task Approach

### Current Approach (Added: 06/23/2025, 10:59:19 PM)

Overview:
Create comprehensive interactive animation pattern documentation in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/interactive/` following T-2.3.1's successful pattern that achieved 98/100 implementation readiness score. I will analyze legacy interactive animation patterns from hover/focus states, transitions, and touch alternatives to produce implementation-ready specifications with precise timing values and accessibility features.

Implementation Strategy:
1. **Legacy Interactive Pattern Analysis Phase**: Systematically examine interactive animation implementations across `aplio-legacy/scss/_button.scss` lines 2-7 (hover/focus), `aplio-legacy/components/shared/FaqItem.jsx` lines 39-43 (transitions), and `aplio-legacy/scss/_common.scss` lines 26-38 (touch alternatives) to extract precise timing values, easing functions, and interaction patterns.

2. **Documentation Structure Creation**: Establish `animations/interactive/` directory and create 4-5 comprehensive documentation files (12KB-25KB each) with consistent markdown structure: hover-animations.md, focus-animations.md, touch-interactions.md, state-transitions.md, and implementation-guide.md, following T-2.3.1's successful pattern.

3. **Interactive Specification Documentation**: Document each animation pattern with implementation-ready specifications including exact timing values (duration/delay), easing function parameters, Framer Motion integration examples, React component integration patterns, and accessibility considerations for focus and hover states.

4. **Touch Device Alternative Documentation**: Include comprehensive touch device alternatives for hover animations, following modern accessibility standards and providing fallback patterns for mobile/tablet devices.

5. **Validation and Quality Assurance**: Validate all legacy code references for 100% accuracy (critical requirement), ensure comprehensive dark mode coverage (25+ references), verify implementation-readiness of all specifications (200+ timing references minimum), and test documentation completeness against T-2.3.1 success standards.

Key Considerations:
- **Legacy Reference Accuracy**: All animation pattern references must cite correct file paths and line numbers - 100% accuracy required for validation success
- **T-2.3.1 Quality Standards**: Must replicate 104KB documentation quality, 98/100 readiness score, and complete dark mode coverage
- **Interactive Animation Focus**: Include hover, focus, click/tap, and state transition animations with accessibility emphasis
- **Touch Device Compatibility**: Comprehensive documentation of touch alternatives for hover-dependent animations
- **Implementation-Ready Specifications**: 200+ timing references minimum, extensive Framer Motion and React patterns

### Approach History

### Current Approach (Added: 06/23/2025, 10:58:35 PM)

Overview:
Create comprehensive animation pattern documentation in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/entry-exit/` following T-2.2.6's successful architecture documentation approach. I will analyze legacy animation patterns from `aplio-legacy/data/animation.js` and `FadeUpAnimation.jsx` to produce implementation-ready specifications with precise timing values, duration settings, and easing functions.

Implementation Strategy:
1. **Legacy Pattern Analysis Phase**: Systematically examine animation implementations across `aplio-legacy/data/animation.js` lines 1-10 (entry), 11-30 (exit), 11-94 (sequencing), and `FadeUpAnimation.jsx` lines 6-11 to extract precise timing values, easing functions, and sequencing patterns.

2. **Documentation Structure Creation**: Establish `animations/entry-exit/` directory and create 4-5 comprehensive documentation files (9KB-15KB each) with consistent markdown structure: entry-animations.md, exit-animations.md, fade-patterns.md, animation-sequencing.md, and implementation-guide.md.

3. **Specification Documentation**: Document each animation pattern with implementation-ready specifications including exact timing values (duration/delay), easing function parameters, Framer Motion integration examples, and React component integration patterns.

4. **Visual Documentation Integration**: Include Mermaid.js animation flow diagrams for complex sequencing patterns and state transition documentation, following T-2.2.6's successful visual documentation approach.

5. **Validation and Quality Assurance**: Validate all legacy code references for accuracy, ensure comprehensive dark mode coverage, verify implementation-readiness of all specifications, and test documentation completeness against acceptance criteria.

Key Considerations:
- **Legacy Reference Accuracy**: All animation pattern references must cite correct file paths and line numbers from legacy codebase
- **Implementation-Ready Specifications**: Documentation must provide sufficient detail for AI agents to implement without ambiguity
- **Consistency with T-2.2.6**: Follow same documentation structure and quality standards that achieved 95/100 score
- **Animation-Specific Requirements**: Include precise timing values, easing functions, and frame-by-frame specifications
- **Dark Mode Coverage**: Ensure all animation patterns include comprehensive dark mode documentation

### Approach History

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-2.3.2:ELE-1] Hover animation documentation: Document hover state animations for all interactive elements
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\scss\_button.scss`:2-7 (hover animations)

### [T-2.3.2:ELE-2] Focus animation documentation: Document focus state animations for all focusable elements

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Analyze hover animation patterns in the legacy codebase (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Study focus animation patterns in the legacy codebase (implements ELE-2)
3. [PREP-3] Identify transition effects between component states (implements ELE-3)
4. [PREP-4] Research touch device alternatives for hover animations (implements ELE-4)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.3.2 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Document hover animation patterns with timing, properties, and easing functions (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Document focus animation patterns with emphasis on accessibility (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Document transition effects between component states with timing details (implements ELE-3)
4. [IMP-4] Document touch device alternatives for hover animations (implements ELE-4)
5. [IMP-5] Create visual reference documentation for interactive animations (implements ELE-1, ELE-2, ELE-3)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.3.2 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify hover animation documentation against legacy implementation (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Verify focus animation documentation against legacy implementation (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Test transition effect documentation with example components (validates ELE-3)
4. [VAL-4] Validate touch device alternative documentation (validates ELE-4)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.3.2 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.
