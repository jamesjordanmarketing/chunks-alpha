## Task Approach

### Current Approach (Added: 09/18/2025, 05:56:25 PM)

Overview:
I will validate existing WorkflowProgressServer and WorkflowProgressClient components against T-1.1.2 acceptance criteria using the validation-first approach proven successful in T-1.1.1. Focus on verifying progress tracking accuracy across all three workflow stages and navigation validation enforcement within the established App Router architecture.

Implementation Strategy:
1. **PREP Phase - Progress System Analysis**
   - Review WorkflowProgressServer.tsx structure to verify server component implementation for progress tracking
   - Analyze workflow-store.ts currentStep/completedSteps state management for progress calculation logic
   - Examine existing stage layouts (stage1/stage2/stage3 pages) to understand progress integration patterns
   - Verify WorkflowProgressClient component for navigation controls and progress display implementation

2. **IMP Phase - Progress Tracking Validation (T-1.1.2:ELE-1)**
   - Test progress bar accuracy: Stage 1 start (0%), Stage 1 complete (~33%), Stage 2 complete (~66%), Stage 3 complete (100%)
   - Validate step completion indicators and checkmarks display correctly across all workflow transitions
   - Verify progress synchronization when navigating between completed stages maintains accurate state
   - Test progress persistence across page refreshes and direct URL access scenarios

3. **IMP Phase - Navigation System Validation (T-1.1.2:ELE-2)**
   - Test navigation enforcement prevents access to incomplete stages while allowing backward navigation to completed stages
   - Validate App Router integration with dynamic document routing patterns (/workflow/[documentId]/stage1|2|3)
   - Verify navigation state persistence and URL route protection against direct manipulation
   - Test navigation controls integration with existing server/client component separation patterns

4. **VAL Phase - Complete Workflow Testing**
   - Execute complete workflow validation across all three stages with multiple document scenarios
   - Verify progress tracking accuracy and navigation validation work together seamlessly
   - Test edge cases: partially completed stages, validation failures, cross-stage navigation
   - Confirm component integration with established StepA/B/C components maintains UI consistency

Key Considerations:
- Progress components likely exist - focus on validation against specific acceptance criteria rather than creation
- Server/client component separation must be maintained per T-1.1.1 established patterns
- Progress percentage calculations must be precise: 0% → 33% → 66% → 100% across stages
- Navigation validation critical for user experience - incomplete stages must be blocked effectively
- Zustand store integration proven functional from T-1.1.1, leverage existing state management patterns

### Approach History

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\brun3a\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.

## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.2:ELE-1] Progress tracking validation: Verify progress bar and step indicators function correctly

### [T-1.1.2:ELE-2] Navigation system validation: Verify stage navigation and validation enforcement

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.
   - **DSAP REQUIREMENT**: Complete STEP 1 (Documentation Discovery) during this phase for all design-related tasks.

1. [PREP-1] Review current progress tracking implementation (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Analyze navigation validation logic in workflow store (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.
   - **DSAP REQUIREMENT**: Complete STEP 2 (Compliance Implementation) during this phase for all design-related tasks.

1. [IMP-1] Test progress bar updates across all three workflow stages (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Validate step completion indicators and checkmarks (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Test navigation controls and validation enforcement (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Verify App Router integration with dynamic document routing (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.
   - **DSAP REQUIREMENT**: Complete STEP 3 (Adherence Reporting) during this phase for all design-related tasks.

1. [VAL-1] Confirm progress tracking accuracy across complete workflow (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test navigation validation prevents skipping incomplete steps (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Verify URL routing works correctly for all workflow stages (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

### New Dependencies
When implementing this task, if you identify a dependency requirement that meets BOTH criteria:
1. Not documented in the Task Information section
2. Not already implemented in the codebase

You MUST document this dependency by executing:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js log-dependency "[task-id]" "[detailed dependency specification]"
```
Your dependency specification should include:
- What the dependency is (library, component, service, etc.)
- Why it's necessary for the current task
- How it impacts the implementation approach

After logging the dependency, paste the command output here and await human operator guidance before proceeding with implementation that relies on this dependency.

### Improvement Suggestions
During implementation, if you identify potential improvements that would enhance:
- Code quality or maintainability
- System flexibility or extensibility
- Feature capabilities or user experience
- Performance or security characteristics

You MUST document these insights by executing:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js log-improvement "[task-id]" "[improvement specification]"
```
Your improvement specification should:
- Clearly articulate the proposed enhancement
- Provide a technical rationale for the suggestion
- Indicate the scope of impact (localized or system-wide)
- Note whether the improvement is critical or could be implemented later

After logging the improvement, paste the command output here, notify the human operator, and continue with your current task implementation.
- [09/18/2025, 06:02:52 PM] Improvement: Critical navigation security gap identified - Direct URL access to workflow stages bypasses validation. Users can access /stage2 and /stage3 without completing prerequisites. Recommend implementing route guards using useEffect + redirect logic in each stage page component to enforce proper stage progression as required by T-1.1.2 acceptance criteria.

IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that you are following the explicit path set for you in this file:
1. Read the active-task.md file to refresh context
2. Return back to what you were doing if it is contributing to the current task
3. If you are working on code that does not contribute to the current task, send a high priority alert to the human operator

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that your current approach to the task is valid you MUST read the Task Approach section of the current active-task.md:
1. If the approach is still valid, continue coding
2. If the approach has new context or details, add an **Addendum** to the Task Approach
3. If the approach has proven to be erroneous, add a **Major Approach Update** with detailed explanation

New bash shells ALWAYS open in pmc by default. Navigate accordingly when you start a new shell

We have been having some problems with bash terminals hanging on commands. To fix this append ` | cat` to all bash commands. The cat command reads all input and then terminates cleanly when the input stream closes. This ensures the command pipeline has a definitive end point.
