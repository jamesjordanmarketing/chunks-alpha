## Task Approach

### Current Approach (Added: 06/19/2025, 11:28:28 AM)

Overview:
Create comprehensive feature section documentation by analyzing the Feature.jsx component (lines 38-61) and applying T-2.2.2's proven 96.5% legacy fidelity methodology. Focus on the 3-column grid layout, feature cards with image/text structure, responsive breakpoints, and hover animations to achieve professional documentation quality standards.

Implementation Strategy:
1. **Legacy Component Analysis**: Conduct detailed analysis of Feature.jsx covering section layout structure (lines 36-37), 3-column responsive grid system (`grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`), and container specifications (`container pb-[150px]`). Extract precise Tailwind classes, spacing patterns, and layout hierarchy for complete documentation accuracy.

2. **Feature Card Documentation**: Document card structure including dimensions (`max-w-[402px]`), styling (`bg-white p-8 shadow-nav dark:bg-dark-200`), border behavior (`border-transparent hover:dark:border-borderColour-dark`), and internal layout. Capture figure/figcaption organization, image dual-mode display (light/dark), and content spacing (`mt-10 mb-2.5`).

3. **Responsive Grid System**: Document breakpoint transitions from single column (`grid-cols-1`) to two columns (`sm:grid-cols-2`) to three columns (`lg:grid-cols-3`). Include gap specifications (`gap-8`), alignment properties (`items-center justify-center`), and responsive padding adjustments (`max-lg:p-5`).

4. **Animation and Interaction Effects**: Document hover state transitions (`transition-colors hover:transition-colors`), border color changes on hover, and dark mode image switching behavior. Capture timing specifications and visual feedback patterns for comprehensive interaction documentation.

5. **Quality Validation**: Apply T-2.2.2's proven validation methodology including direct source code verification, Tailwind class accuracy testing, and comprehensive specification documentation. Target 90%+ legacy fidelity through precise class matching and detailed measurement documentation.

Key Considerations:
- **Grid System Precision**: Three-tier responsive grid requires accurate breakpoint documentation and spacing specifications
- **Dual-Mode Image Handling**: Light/dark theme image switching must be documented with precise visibility classes and implementation patterns
- **Card Component Structure**: Figure/figcaption semantic structure with specific typography and spacing requirements needs detailed documentation
- **Hover State Complexity**: Multi-layer hover effects including border, color, and transition timing require comprehensive state documentation
- **Legacy Fidelity Standard**: Must achieve T-2.2.2's 96.5% accuracy standard through direct Feature.jsx source validation and precise Tailwind specification matching

### Approach History

### Current Approach (Added: 06/19/2025, 01:40:26 AM)

Overview:
Create comprehensive navigation documentation by analyzing the complex PrimaryNavbar.jsx component (lines 12-303) and applying T-2.2.1's 100% legacy fidelity standards. Focus on header layout, desktop navigation with dropdowns, mobile hamburger menu, and accessibility patterns to match the exceptional quality achieved in core UI component documentation.

Implementation Strategy:
1. **Legacy Component Analysis**: Conduct deep analysis of PrimaryNavbar.jsx covering header structure (lines 12-50), desktop navigation with mega-menu dropdowns (lines 51-142), mobile menu with hamburger animation (lines 176-238), and accessibility implementation (lines 47-112). Extract precise Tailwind classes, z-index layering, animation timing, and responsive breakpoints.

2. **Header Documentation Creation**: Document header layout including sticky behavior (`nav-sticky` class), logo positioning (`xl:min-w-[266px]`), container structure, and PT8 padding. Capture background transitions (`bg-transparent pt-8 transition-all duration-500`) and z-index management (`z-50 max-md:z-[500]`).

3. **Desktop Navigation Documentation**: Document nav-list styling (`rounded-large bg-white p-2.5 shadow-nav dark:bg-dark-200`), menu item hover states (`hover:border-borderColor hover:bg-white hover:duration-500`), dropdown implementations (regular and mega-menu), and icon animations (`duration-500 group-hover:rotate-180`).

4. **Mobile Menu Documentation**: Document mobile menu structure (`mobile-menu max-lg:overflow-y-auto`), hamburger button implementation (h-10 w-10 rounded-full), slide-out animation states, close button positioning (`absolute right-6 top-5`), and responsive layout (`max-w-[500px] flex-col gap-5`).

5. **Validation and Testing**: Apply T-2.2.1's validation methodology including direct source code verification, specification accuracy testing, and comprehensive state documentation. Ensure 100% legacy fidelity through precise class matching and exact measurement documentation.

Key Considerations:
- **Multi-Component Complexity**: Navigation involves header + desktop menu + mobile menu coordination requiring integrated documentation approach
- **Animation State Precision**: Complex transitions including dropdown scaling (`scale-y-0` to `scale-y-100`), icon rotations, and mobile menu animations need detailed timing specs
- **Accessibility Requirements**: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and ARIA patterns must be thoroughly documented per task requirements
- **Responsive Integration**: Desktop-to-mobile transitions, hamburger menu triggers, and breakpoint-specific behaviors require comprehensive coverage
- **Legacy Fidelity Standard**: Must achieve same 100% accuracy as T-2.2.1 through direct source code validation and precise Tailwind specification matching

### Approach History

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Analyze feature section components in the legacy codebase (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
2. [PREP-2] Identify responsive behavior at different breakpoints (implements ELE-3)
3. [PREP-3] Study animation patterns used in feature sections (implements ELE-4)
4. [PREP-4] Create documentation template for feature section visual characteristics (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.2.3 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Document feature section layout structure and grid system (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Document feature card design, spacing, typography, and variants (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Document responsive behavior and layout changes at each breakpoint (implements ELE-3)
4. [IMP-4] Document animation patterns, timing, and interaction effects (implements ELE-4)
5. [IMP-5] Create visual reference documentation for feature section design (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.2.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify feature section layout documentation against legacy implementation (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Verify feature card documentation against legacy implementation (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Test responsive behavior documentation at different viewports (validates ELE-3)
4. [VAL-4] Confirm animation patterns are accurately documented (validates ELE-4)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.2.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.
