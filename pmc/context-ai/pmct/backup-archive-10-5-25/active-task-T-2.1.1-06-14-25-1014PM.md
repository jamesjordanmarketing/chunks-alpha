## Acceptance Criteria
To successfully complete this task, you must:

- Extract all color tokens from legacy system with exact hex values
- Implement type-safe color token definitions using TypeScript
- Document color variations for different states (hover, active, focus, disabled)
- Structure color tokens in a format optimized for Next.js 14 implementation

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach

### Current Approach (Added: 06/14/2025, 07:35:00 PM)

Overview:
I will extract the complete color system from the legacy Aplio tailwind.config.js file and implement type-safe TypeScript color tokens for Next.js 14. The approach involves analyzing the existing color palette (primary, dark, gray, border, paragraph, rating) with their variations, creating TypeScript interfaces for color tokens, and structuring them in an optimized format at styles/design-tokens/colors.ts with comprehensive state variations.

Implementation Strategy:
1. **Legacy Color Analysis and Extraction**
   - Extract primary colors (DEFAULT: #B1E346, 100: #F3F8E8, 200: #C4F241) from tailwind.config.js lines 25-56
   - Document dark theme colors (DEFAULT: #131410, variants 100-300) and gray system (DEFAULT: #F6F8F1, variants 50-200)
   - Capture specialized colors (borderColor, paragraph, rating) with exact hex values for visual accuracy
   - Map color usage patterns to identify missing state variations needed for modern implementation

2. **TypeScript Color Token Structure Design**
   - Create ColorPalette interface defining primary, secondary, accent, neutral color scales with proper typing
   - Design ColorToken type supporting DEFAULT, numeric variants (50, 100, 200, etc.), and semantic naming
   - Implement ColorStateVariations interface for hover, active, focus, disabled states using consistent naming conventions
   - Structure color organization following design token best practices for scalability

3. **Color Token Implementation and Documentation**
   - Create styles/design-tokens/colors.ts file with complete color constant definitions as TypeScript objects
   - Implement type-safe exports using const assertions and proper typing for all color tokens
   - Document state variations (hover: 10% darker, active: 15% darker, focus: ring colors, disabled: 50% opacity)
   - Structure tokens in format optimized for Next.js 14 CSS-in-JS and Tailwind CSS integration

4. **Directory Structure and Organization**
   - Create styles/design-tokens/ directory structure following modern design system patterns
   - Organize color tokens by category (primary, semantic, state) with clear export patterns
   - Implement barrel exports for easy consumption across Next.js 14 components
   - Structure files to support future design token expansion (typography, spacing, etc.)

5. **Validation and Type Safety Verification**
   - Verify extracted colors match legacy implementation pixel-perfect using visual comparison
   - Validate TypeScript interfaces compile correctly and provide proper IDE intellisense
   - Test color token imports and usage patterns in Next.js 14 environment
   - Ensure 90% test coverage with comprehensive color token validation tests

Key Considerations:
- Legacy tailwind.config.js contains complete color definitions requiring exact hex value preservation
- TypeScript type safety critical for design system consistency and developer experience  
- Next.js 14 optimization requires proper tree-shaking support through structured exports
- State variations need systematic approach since legacy system lacks comprehensive interactive states
- Directory structure must support future design token expansion while maintaining organization

### Approach History

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-2.1.1:ELE-1] Primary color palette extraction: Create TypeScript definitions for primary, secondary, accent, and neutral color scales
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\tailwind.config.js`:25-56 (color palette definitions)

### [T-2.1.1:ELE-2] State variation colors: Document and implement color variations for different interactive states (hover, active, focus, disabled)
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\design-system\tokens\colors.json`:150-211 (state variations)

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Analyze legacy color definitions in tailwind.config.js and colors.json (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify all color usage patterns and variations in the legacy codebase (implements ELE-2)
3. [PREP-3] Plan TypeScript structure for color token definitions (implements ELE-3)
4. [PREP-4] Create directory structure for design tokens (implements ELE-4)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.1.1 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create colors.ts file with primary color palette definitions as TypeScript constants (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Extract and document secondary and accent color scales with exact hex values (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Extract and document neutral color scale with all variations (implements ELE-1)
4. [IMP-4] Document and implement hover, active, focus, and disabled state color variations (implements ELE-2)
5. [IMP-5] Create TypeScript interfaces and types for color tokens (implements ELE-3)
6. [IMP-6] Structure color tokens in a format optimized for the project (implements ELE-4)
7. [IMP-7] Create type-safe exports for all color tokens (implements ELE-3, ELE-4)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.1.1 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Compare extracted colors with legacy implementation for visual accuracy (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Verify all state variations are properly documented and implemented (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Validate type definitions for color tokens (validates ELE-3)
4. [VAL-4] Verify color organization and export structure (validates ELE-4)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.1.1 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.
