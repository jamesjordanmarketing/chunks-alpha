We need to update the carryover file to prepare the next agent to work.  

You will add all of the appropriate information here:
system\plans\new-panels\new-panel-new-task-06-21-25-1130AM.md

First read: system\plans\new-panels\new-panel-new-task-06-21-25-1130AM.md to understand how to update it correctly. Remove any sections not used.

The Active Development Focus for the next agent is we are going to start executing the next task. Review the entire steps and actions completed here and examine any possible gaps in what the task development requirements are. Now review the next task here: pmc\core\active-task.md.

Your main task is to create a carry over file so the next agent can implement the next task with full and current context. Including:
   - Include any critical context needed for the new task
   - Reference relevant documentation and specifications
   - Maintain links between related tasks and components
   - Document any decisions or changes executed by this chat panel that will affect the next task
   - Look for any requirements gaps from this task that should be included in the next task
   - Mention any variations you made during this chat panel's task testing which affect the implementation of the next task.
   - Update the appropriate sections in system\plans\new-panels\new-panel-new-task-06-21-25-1130AM.md

Do NOT attempt to fix or add any code or content to this task. We will hand it over to the unit testing engineer.  

One more reminder. Your job is ONLY to update system\plans\new-panels\new-panel-new-task-06-21-25-1130AM.md with an in depth context build of all of the information it will need to fully analyze the prompts document.
