# AI Coding Conductor Prompt - T-2.3.3 Implementation

## Critical Context Overview

You are implementing **T-2.3.3: Scroll-Based Animation Pattern Documentation**, building directly on the exceptional success of T-2.3.2 (98/100 implementation readiness score). Your mission is to replicate and exceed the proven T-2.3.2 success pattern while creating comprehensive scroll-based animation documentation.

**Success Framework**: You have TWO complementary instruction sources that work together:
1. **`pmc/core/active-task.md`** - Defines the formal T-2.3.3 task structure, elements, and phases
2. **`system/plans/new-panels/02-new-task-carry-context-06-23-25-1144PM.md`** - Provides critical context from T-2.3.2 success and implementation guidelines

These documents are **complementary, not conflicting**. Use both to achieve excellence.

## Step-by-Step Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Generate Task Approach (CRITICAL)

**Read both context files first:**
- `pmc/core/active-task.md` - T-2.3.3 formal task definition
- `system/plans/new-panels/02-new-task-carry-context-06-23-25-1144PM.md` - T-2.3.2 success patterns and critical context

**Then execute the task approach generation:**
- Read `pmc/system/coding-prompts/02-task-approach-prompt.md`
- Generate your implementation approach in `pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-task-approach.md`
- **Critical**: Your approach MUST incorporate T-2.3.2 success patterns (98/100 score) from the carryover context

### Step 2: Integrate Task Approach

**Navigate to pmc directory and execute:**
```bash
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

**Validation**: Verify the Task Approach section in `pmc/core/active-task.md` shows an "Added:" notation. If not, request human assistance.

### Step 3: Execute T-2.3.3 Implementation

**Primary Focus**: Implement T-2.3.3 following `pmc/core/active-task.md` while applying critical context from the carryover file.

**Key Success Requirements from T-2.3.2 Pattern:**
- **100% Legacy Reference Accuracy** (CRITICAL - zero tolerance for errors)
- **Total Documentation**: 80KB-120KB (T-2.3.2 achieved 97KB)
- **Individual Files**: 15KB-25KB each (5 files minimum)
- **Dark Mode Coverage**: 50+ specifications minimum
- **WCAG 2.1 Compliance**: Full accessibility with reduced motion support

**Implementation Sequence:**
1. **PREP Phase (PREP-1 to PREP-4)**: Analyze legacy references from `FAQWithLeftText.jsx` and `FadeUpAnimation.jsx`
2. **IMP Phase (IMP-1 to IMP-5)**: Create 5 comprehensive scroll animation documentation files
3. **VAL Phase (VAL-1 to VAL-4)**: Validate against T-2.3.2 quality benchmarks

**Critical Legacy References for T-2.3.3:**
- `aplio-legacy/components/home-4/FAQWithLeftText.jsx` lines 22-35 (scroll triggers, parallax, trigger points)
- `aplio-legacy/components/animations/FadeUpAnimation.jsx` lines 6-11 (performance techniques)

### Step 4: Enhanced Testing Protocol

**After VAL phase completion, you MUST stop and await human operator instructions for enhanced testing.**

The testing will follow the proven T-2.3.2 enhanced protocol:
- Phase 0: Environment setup with documentation testing tools
- Phase 1: Markdown structure and content validation
- Phase 2: Legacy reference accuracy validation (100% required)
- Phase 3: Code compilation and implementation testing  
- Phase 4: Dark mode coverage and accessibility validation
- Phase 5: Quality assessment against T-2.3.1/T-2.3.2 benchmarks

## T-2.3.3 Specific Requirements

**Scroll Animation Focus Areas:**
- Intersection Observer API integration patterns
- Viewport threshold and trigger point specifications
- Performance optimization for scroll-heavy animations
- Progressive enhancement for reduced motion preferences
- Mobile-specific scroll behavior adaptations

**Documentation Structure (5 Required Files):**
1. `scroll-triggered-animations.md` - Core scroll animation patterns
2. `parallax-effects.md` - Parallax and transformation documentation
3. `progressive-reveal.md` - Content reveal animation patterns
4. `performance-optimization.md` - Performance considerations
5. `implementation-guide.md` - Integration guide

**Quality Benchmarks to Achieve:**
- **Overall Score**: 95%+ (matching T-2.3.1/T-2.3.2 success pattern)
- **Legacy Accuracy**: 100% (CRITICAL requirement)
- **Dark Mode Coverage**: 60+ specifications (exceeding 50+ minimum)
- **Implementation Readiness**: Production-quality Framer Motion patterns
- **Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 compliance with enhanced scroll considerations

## Critical Success Factors

**From T-2.3.2 Success Analysis:**
- Legacy reference accuracy is CRITICAL - any incorrect file/line citations cause failure
- Documentation must be implementation-ready with precise timing values and easing functions
- Dark mode coverage significantly exceeds minimum requirements for comprehensive theming
- Testing directory structure and validation tools are already established

**Scroll-Specific Enhancements:**
- Include GPU acceleration guidelines for scroll animations
- Document animation throttling and debouncing techniques  
- Provide memory management patterns for long scroll sessions
- Address battery optimization for mobile devices

## Error Prevention

**Common Failure Points (Learned from T-2.3.2):**
- Incorrect legacy file paths or line numbers (causes critical failure)
- Insufficient dark mode coverage (minimum 50+ required)
- Missing accessibility considerations (WCAG 2.1 compliance required)
- Inadequate file sizes (must meet 15KB-25KB individual, 80KB-120KB total)

**Success Pattern Replication:**
Use T-2.3.2 documentation structure as your template:
- `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/interactive/hover-animations.md` - Structure reference
- `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/interactive/implementation-guide.md` - Integration patterns
- `test/reports/T-2.3.2/T-2.3.2-comprehensive-validation-report.md` - Quality benchmarks

## Final Instructions

**Your mission**: Create scroll-based animation documentation that matches or exceeds T-2.3.2's 98/100 implementation readiness score while providing comprehensive, accurate, and accessible animation patterns for the modernized Aplio design system.

**Remember**: The carryover context and active task documents work together. Use both to achieve the exceptional quality standards established by T-2.3.2's success.

**Bash Shells: **:New bash shells ALWAYS open in pmc by default. Navigate accordingly when you start a new shell.

**Quality Gate**: Do not proceed past any phase without confirming you meet T-2.3.2 success pattern requirements. Excellence is mandatory, not optional.
