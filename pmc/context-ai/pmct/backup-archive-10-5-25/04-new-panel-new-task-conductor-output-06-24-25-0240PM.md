# AI Coding Conductor Prompt - T-2.4.1 Breakpoint System Documentation

## Mission Statement
Your primary mission is to implement **T-2.4.1: Breakpoint System Documentation** following the proven documentation pattern established by the successfully completed T-2.3.5 Accessibility Documentation. You will leverage both the standard PMC task structure AND critical context from the previous task completion.

## Critical Integration Context
**BEFORE beginning implementation, you MUST understand**:
1. **`pmc\core\active-task.md`** contains your primary task instructions for T-2.4.1
2. **`system\plans\new-panels\02-new-task-carry-context-06-24-25-0240PM.md`** contains essential context from T-2.3.5 completion that directly impacts HOW you implement T-2.4.1

**These files are complementary - NOT conflicting**. The carry context file provides critical implementation patterns and requirements that are NOT in the standard active-task.md file.

## Implementation Protocol

### Step 1: Context Integration & Task Approach Generation

1. **Read Primary Context Sources**:
   - Read `pmc\core\active-task.md` (your main task: T-2.4.1 Breakpoint System Documentation)
   - Read `system\plans\new-panels\02-new-task-carry-context-06-24-25-0240PM.md` (critical context from T-2.3.5 completion)

2. **Generate Task Approach**:
   - Read `pmc\system\coding-prompts\02-task-approach-prompt.md`
   - Execute the task approach generation process, integrating BOTH sources above
   - Your task approach MUST reflect the 5-file documentation pattern proven successful in T-2.3.5

3. **Integrate Task Approach**:
   - Navigate to `pmc` directory if not already there
   - Execute: `node bin\aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach`
   - Verify the Task Approach section in `active-task.md` has an "Added:" notation
   - If no "Added:" notation appears, STOP and request human assistance

### Step 2: Execute T-2.4.1 Implementation

**Follow the active-task.md instructions WITH these critical adaptations from T-2.3.5**:

#### Documentation Structure Requirements
You MUST create exactly 5 documentation files following the proven T-2.3.5 pattern:
1. **`breakpoint-definitions.md`** - Main breakpoint definitions (equivalent to reduced-motion-alternatives.md)
2. **`responsive-guidelines.md`** - Responsive design guidelines (equivalent to animation-accessibility-guidelines.md)
3. **`container-width-constraints.md`** - Container width documentation (equivalent to motion-preference-detection.md)
4. **`breakpoint-testing-guide.md`** - Testing and validation guide (equivalent to accessibility-impact-assessment.md)
5. **`responsive-visual-reference.md`** - Visual reference documentation (equivalent to visual-reference-documentation.md)

#### Legacy Reference Accuracy Standard
- Achieve 100% accuracy to `aplio-legacy/tailwind.config.js` lines 13-23
- Match the accuracy standard established for `animation.js` references in T-2.3.5
- Include exact line number references in all documentation

#### TypeScript Code Standards
- All code examples must compile with TypeScript strict mode
- Follow the compilation patterns proven successful in T-2.3.5
- Include working React hooks and utility functions

#### Cross-Reference Integration
- Seamlessly integrate with T-2.3.5 accessibility documentation
- Document responsive motion accessibility patterns
- Include dark mode responsive considerations as core requirement

### Step 3: Implementation Quality Assurance

**During implementation phases (PREP/IMP/VAL)**:
- Execute all phase update commands as specified in active-task.md
- Apply the Enhanced Documentation Testing Protocol patterns from T-2.3.5
- Validate all examples compile and work correctly
- Verify integration with existing T-2.3.5 documentation

### Step 4: Completion Protocol

1. Complete all VAL phase steps in active-task.md
2. Execute final `node bin\aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.4.1 "VAL" "complete"`
3. STOP and await human instruction for unit testing

## Success Criteria Integration

Your implementation passes when you achieve:
- **Standard active-task.md acceptance criteria** (extract breakpoints, define conventions, document patterns, create guides)
- **Enhanced T-2.3.5 pattern criteria** (5-file structure, 100% legacy accuracy, TypeScript compilation, cross-integration)

## Critical Reminders

1. **Documentation Focus**: T-2.4.1 creates documentation files, NOT React components
2. **Pattern Replication**: Use T-2.3.5's 5-file structure exactly
3. **Legacy Accuracy**: Maintain 100% accuracy to tailwind.config.js source
4. **Integration Required**: Document responsive motion accessibility building on T-2.3.5
5. **TypeScript Compliance**: All examples must compile with strict mode

## Error Handling

- If task approach generation fails: Verify you're in pmc directory
- If context conflicts arise: The carry context file takes precedence for implementation patterns
- If legacy reference accuracy is uncertain: Refer to T-2.3.5 validation patterns
- If integration questions arise: Prioritize seamless connection with T-2.3.5 accessibility docs

**Execute this implementation systematically, leveraging both the PMC task structure AND the proven patterns from T-2.3.5 completion.**
