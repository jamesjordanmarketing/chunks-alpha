## Task Approach

### Current Approach (Added: 09/18/2025, 06:34:12 PM)

Overview:
I will validate existing Zustand persist middleware configuration in workflow-store.ts against T-1.1.3 acceptance criteria using validation-first approach. Focus on verifying auto-save triggers and session restoration work correctly with T-1.1.2 RouteGuard and progress components that depend entirely on persistent state for navigation security and progress accuracy.

Implementation Strategy:
1. **PREP Phase - Persistence Infrastructure Analysis**
   - Review workflow-store.ts Zustand persist middleware configuration to understand current persistence implementation
   - Analyze state partitioning strategy - determine which state properties should persist vs session-only for optimal performance
   - Examine T-1.1.2 dependencies: RouteGuard component requires completedSteps persistence for navigation security
   - Validate existing localStorage data structure and identify gaps against T-1.1.3:ELE-1 and ELE-2 requirements

2. **IMP Phase - Auto-save Validation (T-1.1.3:ELE-1)**
   - Test auto-save triggers across all user interactions: stage completions, form inputs, navigation events
   - Validate localStorage data integrity during stage transitions when RouteGuard and progress systems update simultaneously  
   - Test persistence timing - ensure auto-save doesn't interfere with RouteGuard redirects or progress calculation updates
   - Verify state serialization handles complex data structures (completedSteps arrays, nested form data) correctly

3. **IMP Phase - Session Restoration Testing (T-1.1.3:ELE-2)**
   - Test complete workflow resumption from any saved stage with correct RouteGuard permissions restored
   - Validate progress percentage display (0%/33%/67%/100%) shows correctly immediately after session restoration
   - Test backward navigation to completed stages works instantly after restoration without state inconsistencies
   - Verify persistence recovery handles corrupted localStorage gracefully with safe fallback to initial state

4. **VAL Phase - Cross-Component Integration Testing**
   - Execute full persistence validation across all T-1.1.2 components: WorkflowProgressClient, RouteGuard, stage pages
   - Test multi-tab scenarios and localStorage conflicts when same document open in multiple tabs
   - Validate error handling when localStorage unavailable, full, or corrupted - must not break navigation systems
   - Confirm persistence performance doesn't degrade user experience during rapid stage transitions

Key Considerations:
- T-1.1.2 RouteGuard component depends entirely on persistent completedSteps for navigation access control
- Fixed progress calculation logic from T-1.1.2 must work correctly with persistent state restoration
- Persistence failures will break both navigation security and progress tracking implemented in T-1.1.2
- Auto-save timing must avoid conflicts with RouteGuard redirects and progress updates
- State corruption recovery critical since components now depend on persistent state for core functionality

### Approach History

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\brun3a\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.

## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.3:ELE-1] Auto-save functionality: Verify automatic draft saving triggers correctly

### [T-1.1.3:ELE-2] Session restoration: Validate workflow resumption from saved state

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.
   - **DSAP REQUIREMENT**: Complete STEP 1 (Documentation Discovery) during this phase for all design-related tasks.

1. [PREP-1] Review Zustand persist middleware configuration (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Analyze state partitioning for persistence optimization (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.
   - **DSAP REQUIREMENT**: Complete STEP 2 (Compliance Implementation) during this phase for all design-related tasks.

1. [IMP-1] Test auto-save triggers on all user interactions (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Validate localStorage data structure and integrity (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Test session restoration across browser refresh (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Verify workflow continuation from any saved stage (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.
   - **DSAP REQUIREMENT**: Complete STEP 3 (Adherence Reporting) during this phase for all design-related tasks.

1. [VAL-1] Confirm auto-save preserves all user input accurately (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test complete workflow restoration from localStorage (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Verify data integrity across persistence cycles (validates ELE-1, ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that you are following the explicit path set for you in this file:
1. Read the active-task.md file to refresh context
2. Return back to what you were doing if it is contributing to the current task
3. If you are working on code that does not contribute to the current task, send a high priority alert to the human operator

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that your current approach to the task is valid you MUST read the Task Approach section of the current active-task.md:
1. If the approach is still valid, continue coding
2. If the approach has new context or details, add an **Addendum** to the Task Approach
3. If the approach has proven to be erroneous, add a **Major Approach Update** with detailed explanation

New bash shells ALWAYS open in pmc by default. Navigate accordingly when you start a new shell

We have been having some problems with bash terminals hanging on commands. To fix this append ` | cat` to all bash commands. The cat command reads all input and then terminates cleanly when the input stream closes. This ensures the command pipeline has a definitive end point.
