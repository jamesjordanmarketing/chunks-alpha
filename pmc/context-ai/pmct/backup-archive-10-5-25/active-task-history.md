- Last Updated: 05/04/2025, 09:49:39 AM

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

When you discover or add an implementation file, you MUST call:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js add-implementation-file "<file_path>" <is_primary>
```
Then paste the command output here.

## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.1:ELE-1] Project initialization: Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-legacy\package.json:5-20` for dependencies and project configuration

### [T-1.1.1:ELE-2] Base configuration: Configure essential Next.js settings and dependencies
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-legacy\next.config.js:1-15` for Next.js configuration

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase
1. [PREP-1] Install Node.js and npm if not already available (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Prepare package.json with required dependencies (implements ELE-1)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
1. [IMP-1] Create Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support using create-next-app (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Configure Next.js settings in next.config.js for App Router (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Set up project root files including .gitignore, README.md, and .env.example (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc


### Validation Phase
1. [VAL-1] Verify project initialization with basic Next.js 14 commands (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test configuration with basic build and start commands (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc


After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the update-phase-stage command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`

IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that you are following the explicit path set for you in this file:
1. Read the active-task.md file to refresh context
2. Return back to what you were doing if it is contributing to the current task
3. If you are working on code that does not contribute to the current task, send a high priority alert to the human operator

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that your current approach to the task is valid you MUST read the Task Approach section of the current active-task.md:
1. If the approach is still valid, continue coding
2. If the approach has new context or details, add an **Addendum** to the Task Approach
3. If the approach has proven to be erroneous, add a **Major Approach Update** with detailed explanation

- Last Updated: 05/04/2025, 02:20:33 PM

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

When you discover or add an implementation file, you MUST call:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js add-implementation-file "<file_path>" <is_primary>
```
Then paste the command output here.

## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.1:ELE-1] Project initialization: Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-legacy\package.json:5-20` for dependencies and project configuration

### [T-1.1.1:ELE-2] Base configuration: Configure essential Next.js settings and dependencies
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-legacy\next.config.js:1-15` for Next.js configuration

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase
1. [PREP-1] Install Node.js and npm if not already available (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Prepare package.json with required dependencies (implements ELE-1)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
1. [IMP-1] Create Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support using create-next-app (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Configure Next.js settings in next.config.js for App Router (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Set up project root files including .gitignore, README.md, and .env.example (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc


### Validation Phase
1. [VAL-1] Verify project initialization with basic Next.js 14 commands (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test configuration with basic build and start commands (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc


After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the update-phase-stage command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-dev-work-pad.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-2.1.1:ELE-1] Primary color palette extraction: Create TypeScript definitions for primary, secondary, accent, and neutral color scales
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-legacy\tailwind.config.js`:25-56 (color palette definitions)

### [T-2.1.1:ELE-2] State variation colors: Document and implement color variations for different interactive states (hover, active, focus, disabled)
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1\design-system\tokens\colors.json`:150-211 (state variations)

### [T-2.1.1:ELE-3] Color token type definitions: Create TypeScript types and interfaces for color tokens to ensure type safety
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1\src\lib\design-system\tokens\colors.ts`:19-35 (type definitions)

### [T-2.1.1:ELE-4] Color system organization: Structure color tokens in a format optimized for Next.js 14 implementation
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1\design-system\tokens\colors.json`:3-22 (token organization)

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase
PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all acceptance criteria. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.
1. [PREP-1] Analyze legacy color definitions in tailwind.config.js and colors.json (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify all color usage patterns and variations in the legacy codebase (implements ELE-2)
3. [PREP-3] Plan TypeScript structure for color token definitions (implements ELE-3)
4. [PREP-4] Create directory structure for design tokens (implements ELE-4)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.1.1 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all acceptance criteria. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.
1. [IMP-1] Create colors.ts file with primary color palette definitions as TypeScript constants (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Extract and document secondary and accent color scales with exact hex values (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Extract and document neutral color scale with all variations (implements ELE-1)
4. [IMP-4] Document and implement hover, active, focus, and disabled state color variations (implements ELE-2)
5. [IMP-5] Create TypeScript interfaces and types for color tokens (implements ELE-3)
6. [IMP-6] Structure color tokens in a format optimized for the project (implements ELE-4)
7. [IMP-7] Create type-safe exports for all color tokens (implements ELE-3, ELE-4)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.1.1 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc


### Validation Phase
VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all acceptance criteria. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.
1. [VAL-1] Compare extracted colors with legacy implementation for visual accuracy (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Verify all state variations are properly documented and implemented (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Validate type definitions for color tokens (validates ELE-3)
4. [VAL-4] Verify color organization and export structure (validates ELE-4)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.1.1 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc


After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the update-phase-stage command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.1:ELE-1] Project initialization: Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-legacy\package.json:5-20` for dependencies and project configuration

### [T-1.1.1:ELE-2] Base configuration: Configure essential Next.js settings and dependencies
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-legacy\next.config.js:1-15` for Next.js configuration

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all acceptance criteria. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Install Node.js and npm if not already available (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Prepare package.json with required dependencies (implements ELE-1)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all acceptance criteria. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support using create-next-app (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Configure Next.js settings in next.config.js for App Router (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Set up project root files including .gitignore, README.md, and .env.example (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc


### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all acceptance criteria. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify project initialization with basic Next.js 14 commands (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test configuration with basic build and start commands (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc


After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the update-phase-stage command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all acceptance criteria. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Install Node.js and npm if not already available (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Prepare package.json with required dependencies (implements ELE-1)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all acceptance criteria. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support using create-next-app (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Configure Next.js settings in next.config.js for App Router (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Set up project root files including .gitignore, README.md, and .env.example (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all acceptance criteria. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify project initialization with basic Next.js 14 commands (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test configuration with basic build and start commands (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc


After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the update-phase-stage command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.2.1:ELE-1] TypeScript configuration: Configure TypeScript with strict mode enabled
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-legacy\tsconfig.json:1-20` for if exists

### [T-1.2.1:ELE-2] TypeScript linting: Set up ESLint for TypeScript code quality

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all acceptance criteria. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Research optimal TypeScript settings for Next.js 14 (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify necessary TypeScript compiler options (implements ELE-1)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.2.1 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all acceptance criteria. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create or update tsconfig.json with strict mode enabled (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Configure TypeScript path aliases for simplified imports (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Set up ESLint with TypeScript rules (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Configure VSCode settings for TypeScript (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.2.1 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all acceptance criteria. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify TypeScript compilation works with strict mode (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test ESLint with TypeScript files (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.2.1 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc


After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the update-phase-stage command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-2\T-1.2.1\`

2. [PREP-2] Identify route groups needed for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all acceptance criteria. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create the base app/ directory structure (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Set up route groups including (marketing) and (auth) (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Create placeholder files for each route (implements ELE-1)
4. [IMP-4] Create api/ directory with initial route structure (implements ELE-1)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all acceptance criteria. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify directory structure matches the specification (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test navigation between routes (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc


After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the update-phase-stage command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.1:ELE-1] Project initialization: Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-legacy\package.json:5-20` for dependencies and project configuration

### [T-1.1.1:ELE-2] Base configuration: Configure essential Next.js settings and dependencies
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-legacy\next.config.js:1-15` for Next.js configuration

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all acceptance criteria. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Install Node.js and npm if not already available (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Prepare package.json with required dependencies (implements ELE-1)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all acceptance criteria. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support using create-next-app (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Configure Next.js settings in next.config.js for App Router (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Set up project root files including .gitignore, README.md, and .env.example (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all acceptance criteria. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify project initialization with basic Next.js 14 commands (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test configuration with basic build and start commands (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc


After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the update-phase-stage command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`

1. [PREP-1] Install Node.js and npm if not already available (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Prepare package.json with required dependencies (implements ELE-1)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all acceptance criteria. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support using create-next-app (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Configure Next.js settings in next.config.js for App Router (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Set up project root files including .gitignore, README.md, and .env.example (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all acceptance criteria. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify project initialization with basic Next.js 14 commands (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test configuration with basic build and start commands (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc


After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the update-phase-stage command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.

   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all acceptance criteria. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Map out the full directory structure based on project requirements (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify route groups needed for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all acceptance criteria. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create the base app/ directory structure (implements ELE-1)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>

- Create tests that verify component appearance in various interactive states
- Implement mechanisms to report and visualize component differences
- Ensure tests detect subtle visual regressions across component variations

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-8.1.2:ELE-1] Component tests: Create visual tests for core UI components

### [T-8.1.2:ELE-2] Interactive state testing: Test component visual states (hover, focus, active)

### [T-8.1.2:ELE-3] Reporting mechanism: Create visual diff reporting for failed tests

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all acceptance criteria. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify core components requiring visual testing (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Define test cases for different component states (implements ELE-2)
3. [PREP-3] Create test structure for organized component testing (implements ELE-1)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-8.1.2 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all acceptance criteria. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create visual tests for button components and variants (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement tests for card components and their variations (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Add tests for navigation components including hover states (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Create tests for form elements and their states (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
5. [IMP-5] Implement interactive state simulation and testing (implements ELE-2)
6. [IMP-6] Set up HTML report generation for visual test results (implements ELE-3)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-8.1.2 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all acceptance criteria. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Run tests and verify accuracy of component comparisons (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Validate hover/focus/active state testing (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Review visual diff reports for clarity and usefulness (validates ELE-3)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-8.1.2 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc


After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the update-phase-stage command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-8-1\T-8.1.2\`

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call:

  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-legacy\next.config.js:1-15` for Next.js configuration

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all acceptance criteria. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Install Node.js and npm if not already available (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Prepare package.json with required dependencies (implements ELE-1)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all acceptance criteria. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support using create-next-app (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Configure Next.js settings in next.config.js for App Router (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Set up project root files including .gitignore, README.md, and .env.example (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all acceptance criteria. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify project initialization with basic Next.js 14 commands (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test configuration with basic build and start commands (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc


After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the update-phase-stage command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

- Last Updated: 05/05/2025, 09:36:03 PM

## Acceptance Criteria
To successfully complete this task, you must:

- App directory structure follows Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Route groups are properly organized for marketing and authenticated sections
- Directory structure enables efficient navigation between routes
- File naming adheres to Next.js conventions for special files

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.2:ELE-1] App directory structure: Create the App Router directory structure following Next.js 14 conventions
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\aplio-legacy\app:1-20` for legacy app structure

### [T-1.1.2:ELE-2] Route group organization: Organize route groups for marketing and authenticated sections
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:1-5` for page structure

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Map out the full directory structure based on project requirements (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify route groups needed for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create the base app/ directory structure (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Set up route groups including (marketing) and (auth) (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Create placeholder files for each route (implements ELE-1)
4. [IMP-4] Create api/ directory with initial route structure (implements ELE-1)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify directory structure matches the specification (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test navigation between routes (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.2\`

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.1:ELE-1] Project initialization: Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\aplio-legacy\package.json:5-20` for dependencies and project configuration

### [T-1.1.1:ELE-2] Base configuration: Configure essential Next.js settings and dependencies
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\aplio-legacy\next.config.js:1-15` for Next.js configuration

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Install Node.js and npm if not already available (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Prepare package.json with required dependencies (implements ELE-1)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support using create-next-app (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Configure Next.js settings in next.config.js for App Router (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Set up project root files including .gitignore, README.md, and .env.example (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify project initialization with basic Next.js 14 commands (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test configuration with basic build and start commands (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-2.2.4:ELE-1] Hero section layout documentation: Document the layout structure and content placement
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\PMC\Aplio-Design-System\aplio-25-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\home-4\Hero.jsx`:6-7 (layout structure)

### [T-2.2.4:ELE-2] Hero typography documentation: Document heading, subheading, and CTA text styles
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\PMC\Aplio-Design-System\aplio-25-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\home-4\Hero.jsx`:29-30 (typography)

### [T-2.2.4:ELE-3] Hero section responsive behavior: Document layout changes at different breakpoints
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\PMC\Aplio-Design-System\aplio-25-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\home-4\Hero.jsx`:6-7 (responsive behavior)

### [T-2.2.4:ELE-4] Hero section animation patterns: Document entrance animations and background effects
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\PMC\Aplio-Design-System\aplio-25-a1-c\aplio-legacy\data\animation.js`:1-10 (animation patterns)

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Analyze hero section components in the legacy codebase (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
2. [PREP-2] Identify responsive behavior at different breakpoints (implements ELE-3)
3. [PREP-3] Study animation patterns used in hero sections (implements ELE-4)
4. [PREP-4] Create documentation template for hero section visual characteristics (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.2.4 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Document hero section layout structure and content placement (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Document hero typography styles, scales, and hierarchy (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Document responsive behavior and layout changes at each breakpoint (implements ELE-3)
4. [IMP-4] Document animation patterns, timing, and visual effects (implements ELE-4)
5. [IMP-5] Create visual reference documentation for hero section design (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.2.4 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify hero section layout documentation against legacy implementation (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Verify hero typography documentation against legacy implementation (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Test responsive behavior documentation at different viewports (validates ELE-3)
4. [VAL-4] Confirm animation patterns are accurately documented (validates ELE-4)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.2.4 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.

- App directory structure follows Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Route groups are properly organized for marketing and authenticated sections
- Directory structure enables efficient navigation between routes
- File naming adheres to Next.js conventions for special files

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.2:ELE-1] App directory structure: Create the App Router directory structure following Next.js 14 conventions
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app:1-20` for legacy app structure

### [T-1.1.2:ELE-2] Route group organization: Organize route groups for marketing and authenticated sections
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:1-5` for page structure

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Map out the full directory structure based on project requirements (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify route groups needed for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create the base app/ directory structure (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Set up route groups including (marketing) and (auth) (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Create placeholder files for each route (implements ELE-1)
4. [IMP-4] Create api/ directory with initial route structure (implements ELE-1)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify directory structure matches the specification (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test navigation between routes (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.2\`

   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components requiring loading states (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify error handling boundaries (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create loading.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement Suspense boundaries around dynamic content (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Create error.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement error boundary components (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test loading states with artificial delays (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test error handling by triggering various errors (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-2.5.4:ELE-1] Style composition utilities: Create utility functions for composing styles
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\src\lib\design-system\tokens\colors.ts`:149-182 (style composition)

### [T-2.5.4:ELE-2] Variant prop system: Implement a type-safe variant prop system for components
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\src\lib\design-system\tokens\colors.ts`:77-140 (variant props)

### [T-2.5.4:ELE-3] Style override system: Create a system for component-specific style overrides

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Analyze style composition patterns in the legacy codebase (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Study variant prop systems in design systems (implements ELE-2)
3. [PREP-3] Research component style override strategies (implements ELE-3)
4. [PREP-4] Investigate responsive styling implementation in Next.js 14 (implements ELE-4)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.5.4 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create style composition utility functions with TypeScript (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement a type-safe variant prop system with interfaces (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Build a component style override system with proper typing (implements ELE-3)
4. [IMP-4] Develop breakpoint-aware styling utilities (implements ELE-4)
5. [IMP-5] Create example implementations for common components (implements ELE-1, ELE-2, ELE-3, ELE-4)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.5.4 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test style composition utilities with various scenarios (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Verify variant prop system with component examples (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Validate style override system functionality (validates ELE-3)
4. [VAL-4] Test responsive styling utilities at different breakpoints (validates ELE-4)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.5.4 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-2-5\T-2.5.4\`

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-5.5.2:ELE-1] Question: Implement question component with proper typography and styling
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\home-4\Faq.jsx`:37-39 (question styling)

### [T-5.5.2:ELE-2] Answer: Implement answer component with proper typography and styling
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\home-4\Faq.jsx`:42-44 (answer styling)

### [T-5.5.2:ELE-3] Responsive typography: Implement responsive text sizing for different devices
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\home-4\Faq.jsx`:37-39 (responsive typography)

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Extract question and answer styles from legacy implementation (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Analyze content layout and spacing (implements ELE-2)
3. [PREP-3] Identify responsive typography adjustments (implements ELE-3)
4. [PREP-4] Review accessibility requirements for text content (implements ELE-4)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-5.5.2 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create components for question and answer elements (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement content structure with proper nesting and semantic tags (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Apply responsive typography styles using design tokens (implements ELE-3)
4. [IMP-4] Ensure text elements meet WCAG contrast requirements (implements ELE-4)
5. [IMP-5] Apply proper heading hierarchy and ARIA attributes (implements ELE-4)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-5.5.2 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify question and answer match legacy design (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Check content structure for proper semantics (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Test responsive typography at different breakpoints (validates ELE-3)
4. [VAL-4] Validate content against accessibility requirements (validates ELE-4)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-5.5.2 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-5-5\T-5.5.2\`

## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.3:ELE-1] Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation

### [T-1.1.3:ELE-2] Client component boundaries: Mark interactive components with 'use client' directive
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components that should be server vs. client components (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
2. [PREP-2] Create a component boundary diagram for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Implement base server components for layouts and pages (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Create sample client components with 'use client' directive (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Implement server/client component composition pattern (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify server components render correctly (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test client component interactivity (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Verify proper hydration of client components (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\next.config.js:1-15` for Next.js configuration

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Install Node.js and npm if not already available (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Prepare package.json with required dependencies (implements ELE-1)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support using create-next-app (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Configure Next.js settings in next.config.js for App Router (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Set up project root files including .gitignore, README.md, and .env.example (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify project initialization with basic Next.js 14 commands (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test configuration with basic build and start commands (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.1 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

- Test Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage
- Completes Component?: Not specified
- Confidence: 
- Last Updated: 05/30/2025, 12:39:13 AM

## Acceptance Criteria
To successfully complete this task, you must:

- Non-interactive components are implemented as server components by default
- Client components are explicitly marked with 'use client' directive
- Server/client component composition follows optimal patterns
- Server components render correctly with expected content

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.3:ELE-1] Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation

### [T-1.1.3:ELE-2] Client component boundaries: Mark interactive components with 'use client' directive
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components that should be server vs. client components (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
2. [PREP-2] Create a component boundary diagram for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Implement base server components for layouts and pages (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Create sample client components with 'use client' directive (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Implement server/client component composition pattern (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify server components render correctly (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test client component interactivity (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Verify proper hydration of client components (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.3:ELE-1] Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation

### [T-1.1.3:ELE-2] Client component boundaries: Mark interactive components with 'use client' directive
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components that should be server vs. client components (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
2. [PREP-2] Create a component boundary diagram for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Implement base server components for layouts and pages (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Create sample client components with 'use client' directive (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Implement server/client component composition pattern (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify server components render correctly (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test client component interactivity (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Verify proper hydration of client components (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.

3. [IMP-3] Create error.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement error boundary components (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test loading states with artificial delays (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test error handling by triggering various errors (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Acceptance Criteria
To successfully complete this task, you must:

- Non-interactive components are implemented as server components by default
- Client components are explicitly marked with 'use client' directive
- Server/client component composition follows optimal patterns
- Server components render correctly with expected content

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.3:ELE-1] Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation

### [T-1.1.3:ELE-2] Client component boundaries: Mark interactive components with 'use client' directive
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components that should be server vs. client components (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
2. [PREP-2] Create a component boundary diagram for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Implement base server components for layouts and pages (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Create sample client components with 'use client' directive (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Implement server/client component composition pattern (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify server components render correctly (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test client component interactivity (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Verify proper hydration of client components (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.3\`

### [T-1.1.3:ELE-1] Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation

### [T-1.1.3:ELE-2] Client component boundaries: Mark interactive components with 'use client' directive
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components that should be server vs. client components (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
2. [PREP-2] Create a component boundary diagram for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Implement base server components for layouts and pages (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Create sample client components with 'use client' directive (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Implement server/client component composition pattern (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify server components render correctly (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test client component interactivity (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Verify proper hydration of client components (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

- Root layout provides basic HTML structure for all pages
- Nested layouts optimize code sharing for route groups
- Metadata is implemented for SEO optimization
- Dynamic metadata generation works correctly for various routes

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.5:ELE-1] Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30` for root layout implementation

### [T-1.1.5:ELE-2] Metadata API: Implement metadata for SEO optimization
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12` for page metadata

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Plan layout hierarchy for the application (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify metadata requirements for each route (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create root layout.tsx with basic HTML structure (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement nested layouts for route groups (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Add metadata export to root layout (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement dynamic metadata generation (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify layout nesting works as expected (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test metadata appears correctly in page source (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.5\`

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.3:ELE-1] Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation

### [T-1.1.3:ELE-2] Client component boundaries: Mark interactive components with 'use client' directive
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components that should be server vs. client components (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
2. [PREP-2] Create a component boundary diagram for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Implement base server components for layouts and pages (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Create sample client components with 'use client' directive (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Implement server/client component composition pattern (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify server components render correctly (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test client component interactivity (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Verify proper hydration of client components (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview

- Last Updated: 06/02/2025, 09:30:34 PM

## Acceptance Criteria
To successfully complete this task, you must:

- App directory structure follows Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Route groups are properly organized for marketing and authenticated sections
- Directory structure enables efficient navigation between routes
- File naming adheres to Next.js conventions for special files

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.2:ELE-1] App directory structure: Create the App Router directory structure following Next.js 14 conventions
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app:1-20` for legacy app structure

### [T-1.1.2:ELE-2] Route group organization: Organize route groups for marketing and authenticated sections
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:1-5` for page structure

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Map out the full directory structure based on project requirements (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify route groups needed for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create the base app/ directory structure (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Set up route groups including (marketing) and (auth) (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Create placeholder files for each route (implements ELE-1)
4. [IMP-4] Create api/ directory with initial route structure (implements ELE-1)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify directory structure matches the specification (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test navigation between routes (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.2 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.4:ELE-1] Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator

### [T-1.1.4:ELE-2] Error handling: Implement error.tsx files for error handling
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components requiring loading states (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify error handling boundaries (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create loading.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement Suspense boundaries around dynamic content (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Create error.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement error boundary components (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test loading states with artificial delays (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test error handling by triggering various errors (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.4\`

1. [IMP-1] Create loading.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement Suspense boundaries around dynamic content (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Create error.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement error boundary components (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test loading states with artificial delays (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test error handling by triggering various errors (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.4:ELE-1] Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator

### [T-1.1.4:ELE-2] Error handling: Implement error.tsx files for error handling
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components requiring loading states (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify error handling boundaries (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create loading.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement Suspense boundaries around dynamic content (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Create error.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement error boundary components (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test loading states with artificial delays (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test error handling by triggering various errors (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.4\`

### [T-1.1.5:ELE-1] Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30` for root layout implementation

### [T-1.1.5:ELE-2] Metadata API: Implement metadata for SEO optimization
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12` for page metadata

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Plan layout hierarchy for the application (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify metadata requirements for each route (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create root layout.tsx with basic HTML structure (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement nested layouts for route groups (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Add metadata export to root layout (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement dynamic metadata generation (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify layout nesting works as expected (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test metadata appears correctly in page source (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

- Root layout provides basic HTML structure for all pages
- Nested layouts optimize code sharing for route groups
- Metadata is implemented for SEO optimization
- Dynamic metadata generation works correctly for various routes

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.5:ELE-1] Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30` for root layout implementation

### [T-1.1.5:ELE-2] Metadata API: Implement metadata for SEO optimization
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12` for page metadata

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Plan layout hierarchy for the application (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify metadata requirements for each route (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create root layout.tsx with basic HTML structure (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement nested layouts for route groups (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Add metadata export to root layout (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement dynamic metadata generation (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify layout nesting works as expected (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test metadata appears correctly in page source (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.5\`

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.5:ELE-1] Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30` for root layout implementation

### [T-1.1.5:ELE-2] Metadata API: Implement metadata for SEO optimization
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12` for page metadata

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Plan layout hierarchy for the application (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify metadata requirements for each route (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create root layout.tsx with basic HTML structure (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement nested layouts for route groups (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Add metadata export to root layout (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement dynamic metadata generation (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify layout nesting works as expected (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test metadata appears correctly in page source (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

To successfully complete this task, you must:

- Loading states are implemented using loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
- Error handling is implemented at appropriate component boundaries with error.tsx files
- Loading states provide a good user experience during data fetching
- Error states handle various error scenarios gracefully

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.4:ELE-1] Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator

### [T-1.1.4:ELE-2] Error handling: Implement error.tsx files for error handling
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components requiring loading states (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify error handling boundaries (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create loading.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement Suspense boundaries around dynamic content (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Create error.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement error boundary components (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test loading states with artificial delays (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test error handling by triggering various errors (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.4:ELE-1] Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator

### [T-1.1.4:ELE-2] Error handling: Implement error.tsx files for error handling
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components requiring loading states (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify error handling boundaries (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create loading.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement Suspense boundaries around dynamic content (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Create error.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement error boundary components (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test loading states with artificial delays (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test error handling by triggering various errors (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.

node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test loading states with artificial delays (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test error handling by triggering various errors (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.4:ELE-1] Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator

### [T-1.1.4:ELE-2] Error handling: Implement error.tsx files for error handling
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components requiring loading states (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify error handling boundaries (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create loading.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement Suspense boundaries around dynamic content (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Create error.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement error boundary components (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test loading states with artificial delays (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test error handling by triggering various errors (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.4\`

  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator

### [T-1.1.4:ELE-2] Error handling: Implement error.tsx files for error handling
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components requiring loading states (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify error handling boundaries (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create loading.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement Suspense boundaries around dynamic content (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Create error.tsx files for route segments (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement error boundary components (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test loading states with artificial delays (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test error handling by triggering various errors (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

- Confidence: 
- Last Updated: 06/03/2025, 02:49:11 PM

## Acceptance Criteria
To successfully complete this task, you must:

- Non-interactive components are implemented as server components by default
- Client components are explicitly marked with 'use client' directive
- Server/client component composition follows optimal patterns
- Server components render correctly with expected content

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.3:ELE-1] Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation

### [T-1.1.3:ELE-2] Client component boundaries: Mark interactive components with 'use client' directive
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components that should be server vs. client components (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
2. [PREP-2] Create a component boundary diagram for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Implement base server components for layouts and pages (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Create sample client components with 'use client' directive (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Implement server/client component composition pattern (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify server components render correctly (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test client component interactivity (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Verify proper hydration of client components (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.3\`

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.5:ELE-1] Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30` for root layout implementation

### [T-1.1.5:ELE-2] Metadata API: Implement metadata for SEO optimization
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12` for page metadata

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Plan layout hierarchy for the application (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify metadata requirements for each route (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create root layout.tsx with basic HTML structure (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement nested layouts for route groups (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Add metadata export to root layout (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement dynamic metadata generation (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify layout nesting works as expected (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test metadata appears correctly in page source (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.5 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

- Confidence: 
- Last Updated: 06/03/2025, 06:12:58 PM

## Acceptance Criteria
To successfully complete this task, you must:

- Non-interactive components are implemented as server components by default
- Client components are explicitly marked with 'use client' directive
- Server/client component composition follows optimal patterns
- Server components render correctly with expected content

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.3:ELE-1] Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation

### [T-1.1.3:ELE-2] Client component boundaries: Mark interactive components with 'use client' directive
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components that should be server vs. client components (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
2. [PREP-2] Create a component boundary diagram for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Implement base server components for layouts and pages (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Create sample client components with 'use client' directive (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Implement server/client component composition pattern (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify server components render correctly (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test client component interactivity (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Verify proper hydration of client components (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.1.3:ELE-1] Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation

### [T-1.1.3:ELE-2] Client component boundaries: Mark interactive components with 'use client' directive
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify components that should be server vs. client components (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
2. [PREP-2] Create a component boundary diagram for the application (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Implement base server components for layouts and pages (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Create sample client components with 'use client' directive (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Implement server/client component composition pattern (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify server components render correctly (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test client component interactivity (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Verify proper hydration of client components (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.3\`

3. [IMP-3] Implement server/client component composition pattern (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify server components render correctly (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test client component interactivity (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Verify proper hydration of client components (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.1.4 "VAL" "complete"

- TypeScript is configured with strict mode enabled
- TypeScript path aliases are set up for simplified imports
- ESLint is configured to enforce TypeScript rules
- TypeScript compilation works correctly with the configuration

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.2.1:ELE-1] TypeScript configuration: Configure TypeScript with strict mode enabled
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\tsconfig.json:1-20` for if exists

### [T-1.2.1:ELE-2] TypeScript linting: Set up ESLint for TypeScript code quality

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Research optimal TypeScript settings for Next.js 14 (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify necessary TypeScript compiler options (implements ELE-1)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.2.1 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create or update tsconfig.json with strict mode enabled (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Configure TypeScript path aliases for simplified imports (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Set up ESLint with TypeScript rules (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Configure VSCode settings for TypeScript (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.2.1 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify TypeScript compilation works with strict mode (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test ESLint with TypeScript files (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.2.1 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-2\T-1.2.1\`

```

You can also call this command at other times if it will help record context that may be useful while coding this task.

## Notes
You may add implementation notes at any time by calling:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-notes "<your implementation notes>"
```
Task initialized on 06/07/2025, 10:27:05 AM
Implementation Status: Not Started

## Errors Encountered
If you encounter any errors, you MUST report them by calling:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
```
If you have tried to fix an error 5 times and have not made any progress, you MUST call the error command, alert the human operator, and stop coding.

  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\utils\helpers.js:1-50` for utility functions

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Identify API endpoints and data structures (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Catalog utility functions requiring type definitions (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.2.3 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create request type interfaces for API endpoints (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Create response type interfaces for API endpoints (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Add type definitions to utility functions (implements ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Implement generic types for reusable utilities (implements ELE-2)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.2.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify API calls with type checking (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test utility functions with various inputs (validates ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.2.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

Is this task dependent on the current task? Yes

### New Dependencies
When implementing this task, if you identify a dependency requirement that meets BOTH criteria:
1. Not documented in the Task Information section
2. Not already implemented in the codebase

You MUST document this dependency by executing:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js log-dependency "[task-id]" "[detailed dependency specification]"
```
Your dependency specification should include:
- What the dependency is (library, component, service, etc.)
- Why it's necessary for the current task
- How it impacts the implementation approach

After logging the dependency, paste the command output here and await human operator guidance before proceeding with implementation that relies on this dependency.

### Improvement Suggestions
During implementation, if you identify potential improvements that would enhance:
- Code quality or maintainability
- System flexibility or extensibility
- Feature capabilities or user experience
- Performance or security characteristics

You MUST document these insights by executing:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js log-improvement "[task-id]" "[improvement specification]"
```
Your improvement specification should:
- Clearly articulate the proposed enhancement
- Provide a technical rationale for the suggestion
- Indicate the scope of impact (localized or system-wide)
- Note whether the improvement is critical or could be implemented later

After logging the improvement, paste the command output here, notify the human operator, and continue with your current task implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria
To successfully complete this task, you must:

- Server components are implemented by default for non-interactive components
- Client components are explicitly marked with 'use client' directive
- Composition patterns optimize client/server boundaries
- Data fetching is isolated to server components

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.3.2:ELE-1] Server component defaults: Implement server-first component approach
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:1-30` for page component structure

### [T-1.3.2:ELE-2] Client component boundaries: Define explicit client boundaries for interactive elements
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-15` for interactive component

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Analyze server vs. client component requirements (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
2. [PREP-2] Create component boundary diagrams (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.3.2 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create base server component template (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement client component wrapper pattern (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Create composition patterns for server/client boundaries (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Set up data fetching patterns for server components (implements ELE-1)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.3.2 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test server component rendering (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Verify client component hydration (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Test composition patterns across boundaries (validates ELE-1, ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.3.2 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
