## Design System Adherence Protocol (DSAP)

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: IF this task involves design, component, token, or animation implementation, you MUST follow the Design System Adherence Protocol.

**Design System Documentation Location**: `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/`

### DSAP Compliance Process

**STEP 1: Documentation Discovery** (PREP Phase)
Search ALL relevant documentation categories:

**Components** (`/components/`):
- `/core/` - buttons.md, cards.md, inputs.md, component-states.md
- `/interactive/` - accordion/, modals/, dropdowns/ (component-specific folders)
- `/navigation/` - nav bars, menus, breadcrumbs
- `/sections/` - page sections, layouts, containers

**Animations** (`/animations/`):
- `/interactive/` - hover-animations.md, focus-animations.md, touch-interactions.md, state-transitions.md
- `/entry-exit/` - page/component mount/unmount animations
- `/timing/` - duration, easing, performance standards
- `/accessibility/` - reduced motion, animation accessibility

**Responsive Design** (`/responsive/`):
- `/breakpoints/` - screen size definitions and usage
- `/typography/` - responsive text scaling
- `/layouts/` - grid systems, spacing
- `/components/` - component responsive behavior

**Architecture** (`/architecture/`):
- `component-hierarchy.md` - component relationships
- `design-system-consistency.md` - visual consistency rules
- `cross-component-styling.md` - shared styling patterns

**STEP 2: Compliance Implementation** (IMP Phase)
- Follow ALL discovered documentation standards
- For missing documentation: implement best practices and document decisions
- Reference specific documentation files in implementation comments

**STEP 3: Adherence Reporting** (VAL Phase)
Create compliance report at: `aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-{series}/T-3.2.3/design-system-adherence-report.md`

**Missing Documentation Protocol**:
- Continue with implementation using best practices
- Document all gaps and agent decisions in adherence report
- Flag gaps for future documentation creation

**FAILURE TO COMPLY**: Implementation without DSAP compliance will be rejected.

## Current Implementation Focus
Currently: Reading task requirements
Phase: Not started
Step: Initial review
Current Element: None - reviewing task requirements

## Acceptance Criteria
To successfully complete this task, you must:

- Accordion container properly renders and manages accordion items
- Both single-open and multiple-open variants are supported
- Container provides state management for controlled and uncontrolled usage
- Focus management works correctly between accordion items
- Component follows Next.js 14 server component patterns where possible
- State is properly synchronized between container and items

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach

### Current Approach (Added: 07/07/2025, 01:14:11 PM)

Overview:
I will implement an Accordion container component that orchestrates existing AccordionItem components from T-3.2.2 using a server component architecture. The container will provide variant support (single-open/multiple-open), state management patterns (controlled/uncontrolled), and focus coordination while preserving T-3.2.2's animation system and accessibility features.

Implementation Strategy:
1. **Foundation Analysis and DSAP Discovery**
   - Analyze existing AccordionItem.tsx, AccordionProvider, and useAccordionAnimation integration points
   - Complete DSAP documentation discovery for container patterns and animation coordination
   - Study legacy CustomFAQ.jsx container implementation for variant behavior patterns
   - Review T-3.2.2's state management approach to avoid conflicts

2. **Server Component Container Architecture**
   - Create Accordion.tsx as optimized server component following P002-SERVER-COMPONENT pattern
   - Implement static rendering with dynamic client component coordination
   - Design props interface supporting both controlled and uncontrolled usage patterns
   - Establish variant prop system for single-open vs multiple-open modes

3. **State Management and Coordination System**
   - Implement hybrid state approach: server rendering + client coordination via AccordionProvider
   - Create controlled mode: parent manages openItems array, container coordinates state
   - Create uncontrolled mode: container manages internal state, delegates to AccordionItem components
   - Build variant logic: single-open auto-closes others, multiple-open allows concurrent states

4. **Focus Management and Accessibility**
   - Extend T-3.2.2's keyboard navigation to multi-item scenarios
   - Implement arrow key navigation between accordion headers
   - Add Home/End key support for first/last item focus
   - Coordinate focus restoration when items are dynamically shown/hidden
   - Maintain ARIA accordion pattern compliance across container

5. **Integration Testing and Validation**
   - Extend T-3.2.2's 18-scaffold testing framework for multi-item scenarios
   - Test container-item state synchronization and variant behavior switching
   - Validate focus management with keyboard navigation across multiple items
   - Ensure animation coordination doesn't interfere with T-3.2.2's 300ms transitions
   - Execute enhanced visual testing protocol with sequential LLM analysis

Key Considerations:
- Must preserve T-3.2.2's existing AccordionItem functionality and 300ms animation timing
- Focus management system must extend, not replace, T-3.2.2's keyboard navigation patterns  
- Server component optimization while maintaining full client-side interactivity coordination
- DSAP compliance target â‰¥95% following T-3.2.2's 98% achievement baseline
- Integration testing requires validation of container-item state synchronization performance

### Approach History

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.
   - **DSAP REQUIREMENT**: Complete STEP 1 (Documentation Discovery) during this phase for all design-related tasks.

1. [PREP-1] Analyze legacy container implementation (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Study variant behavior in legacy code (implements ELE-2)
3. [PREP-3] Review state management approaches (implements ELE-3)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-3.2.3 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.
   - **DSAP REQUIREMENT**: Complete STEP 2 (Compliance Implementation) during this phase for all design-related tasks.

1. [IMP-1] Create Accordion container component (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement variant support for controlling open items (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Add state management for controlled and uncontrolled usage (implements ELE-3)
4. [IMP-4] Implement focus management system (implements ELE-4)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-3.2.3 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.
   - **DSAP REQUIREMENT**: Complete STEP 3 (Adherence Reporting) during this phase for all design-related tasks.

1. [VAL-1] Verify container renders items properly (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Test behavior of different variants (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Verify controlled and uncontrolled state management (validates ELE-3)
4. [VAL-4] Test focus management with keyboard navigation (validates ELE-4)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-3.2.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that you are following the explicit path set for you in this file:
1. Read the active-task.md file to refresh context
2. Return back to what you were doing if it is contributing to the current task
3. If you are working on code that does not contribute to the current task, send a high priority alert to the human operator

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that your current approach to the task is valid you MUST read the Task Approach section of the current active-task.md:
1. If the approach is still valid, continue coding
2. If the approach has new context or details, add an **Addendum** to the Task Approach
3. If the approach has proven to be erroneous, add a **Major Approach Update** with detailed explanation

New bash shells ALWAYS open in pmc by default. Navigate accordingly when you start a new shell

We have been having some problems with bash terminals hanging on commands. To fix this append ` | cat` to all bash commands. The cat command reads all input and then terminates cleanly when the input stream closes. This ensures the command pipeline has a definitive end point.
