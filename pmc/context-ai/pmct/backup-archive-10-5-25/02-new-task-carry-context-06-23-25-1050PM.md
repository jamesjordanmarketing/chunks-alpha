# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 06-23-25-1050PM
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0
**Testing Phase:** T-2.3.2 Interactive Animation Pattern Documentation Implementation

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**Task Summary**: T-2.3.1 Entry and Exit Animation Pattern Documentation has been successfully completed and comprehensively tested. The task created 5 detailed animation documentation files (104KB total, 3,587 lines) in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/entry-exit/` with 100% legacy reference accuracy, complete dark mode coverage, and implementation-ready specifications. All validation phases passed successfully with a 98/100 implementation readiness score.

**Current Implementation Target**: T-2.3.2 Interactive Animation Pattern Documentation must now be implemented, focusing on hover, focus, click/tap, and transition animations. You shall create comprehensive documentation in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/interactive/` directory following the successful T-2.3.1 pattern that achieved complete validation success.

**Implementation Requirements for T-2.3.2**:
- Document hover state animations for all interactive elements
- Document focus state animations for all focusable elements  
- Document click/tap animations and feedback effects
- Document transition effects between component states
- Maintain same quality standards as T-2.3.1 (100% legacy accuracy, dark mode coverage, implementation readiness)

### Critical Implementation Context

**T-2.3.1 Success Pattern**: You must replicate the successful approach used in T-2.3.1 which achieved complete validation success across all 5 testing phases. The key success factors were:
- **Perfect legacy reference accuracy** (284+ timing specifications validated)
- **Comprehensive documentation** (104KB total, exceeding 90KB expectation)
- **Complete dark mode coverage** (25+ references across all files)
- **Implementation-ready specifications** (352 Framer Motion integrations, 95 React patterns)
- **Consistent timing standards** (500ms entry, 300ms exit, 200ms stagger)

**Legacy Code Analysis Requirements**: You shall analyze interactive animation patterns in:
- `aplio-legacy/scss/_button.scss` lines 2-7 (hover/focus animations)
- `aplio-legacy/components/shared/FaqItem.jsx` lines 39-43 (transitions)
- `aplio-legacy/scss/_common.scss` lines 26-38 (touch alternatives)

**Testing Protocol Readiness**: The T-2.3.1 testing protocol demonstrated that documentation-focused validation is critical. You must ensure T-2.3.2 documentation will pass identical validation phases: file existence, legacy reference accuracy, dark mode coverage, implementation readiness, and cross-file consistency.

### Modified Implementation Approaches

**Documentation Structure**: You shall create 4-5 comprehensive documentation files in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/interactive/` following T-2.3.1's successful structure:
- hover-animations.md (expected ~12-15KB)
- focus-animations.md (expected ~10-12KB)  
- touch-interactions.md (expected ~15-18KB)
- state-transitions.md (expected ~18-20KB)
- implementation-guide.md (expected ~20-25KB)

**Legacy Reference Standards**: All references to legacy files must be precise with exact line numbers and accurate timing values. T-2.3.1 validation confirmed this critical requirement - any inaccuracy results in validation failure.

**Dark Mode Integration**: Every animation pattern must include comprehensive dark mode specifications. T-2.3.1 achieved 25+ dark mode references across 5 files - T-2.3.2 must maintain equivalent coverage.

**Implementation Readiness Requirements**: Documentation must provide sufficient technical detail for autonomous AI implementation. T-2.3.1 achieved 98/100 readiness score with 284 timing specifications, 352 Framer Motion integrations, and 95 React patterns.

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The second context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)
- The third context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v3.js` (created when the second got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Add Structured Test Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js test-approach
