# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 06-26-25-1010AM
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses the transition from completed T-2.4.5 Touch Interaction and Accessibility Documentation testing to the implementation of T-2.4.6 Responsive Typography Documentation. The testing agent has completed comprehensive validation of T-2.4.5 documentation, identifying critical implementation insights that will inform the T-2.4.6 implementation approach.

## Active Development Focus

### T-2.4.6 Implementation Requirements
You must implement T-2.4.6: Responsive Typography Documentation, creating comprehensive documentation for responsive typography scaling and behavior in the Next.js 14 design system. This documentation must build upon the proven documentation architecture established by the successfully validated T-2.4.5 Touch Interaction documentation.

**Task Summary**: T-2.4.5 Touch Interaction and Accessibility Documentation has been completed and comprehensively tested through a 6-phase validation protocol. The documentation achieved exceptional quality with 109KB across 5 files (214% of expected size), demonstrating WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, 100% legacy pattern accuracy, and comprehensive testing protocols. This successful pattern provides the foundation for implementing T-2.4.6 typography documentation.

**Implementation Scope for T-2.4.6**:
- Document responsive font sizing strategy across breakpoints
- Document typographic scale implementation for different viewports  
- Document line length and spacing considerations for responsive layouts
- Establish typographic hierarchy patterns for responsive layouts

### Current Active Action
- **Task ID**: T-2.4.6 - Responsive Typography Documentation
- **Current Phase**: Preparation (not started)
- **Implementation Location**: `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/responsive/typography/`
- **Expected Pattern**: 5-file documentation structure following T-2.4.5 proven approach

### Critical Implementation Context

**T-2.4.5 Testing Results Impact on T-2.4.6**:
- **Documentation Architecture Success**: The 5-file structure (definitions, implementation guidelines, constraints specifications, testing guide, visual reference) achieved comprehensive coverage and should be replicated for typography documentation
- **File Size Expectations**: T-2.4.5 achieved 109KB total (vs expected 51KB), indicating comprehensive documentation scope - T-2.4.6 should target similar comprehensive coverage
- **Legacy Pattern Integration**: 100% accuracy to legacy file references was achieved and validated - T-2.4.6 must maintain equivalent accuracy to `aplio-legacy/scss/_typography.scss:16-31`
- **WCAG Compliance Framework**: T-2.4.5 established extensive WCAG 2.1 AA compliance documentation - T-2.4.6 typography must include equivalent accessibility considerations

### Existing Implementation Instructions Adaptations

**Enhanced from T-2.4.5 Experience**:
- **Documentation Size Target**: Based on T-2.4.5 results, expect T-2.4.6 to require 80-120KB total documentation for comprehensive coverage
- **Legacy Reference Accuracy**: All references to `aplio-legacy/scss/_typography.scss:16-31` must be validated for exact line number accuracy and pattern fidelity
- **Cross-Reference Integration**: T-2.4.6 must establish cross-references to T-2.4.1-T-2.4.5 documentation, noting that only T-2.4.2 and T-2.4.5 directories currently exist
- **TypeScript Compliance**: All code examples must be designed for TypeScript strict mode compilation (T-2.4.5 experienced environmental compilation issues)

### Modified Implementation Approaches

**Lessons from T-2.4.5 Implementation**:
1. **Comprehensive Documentation Scope**: The successful T-2.4.5 approach created extensive content - T-2.4.6 should prioritize depth over brevity
2. **Visual Reference Importance**: T-2.4.5's visual reference file (27KB) was critical for understanding - T-2.4.6 typography visuals will be equally important
3. **Testing Protocol Integration**: Include comprehensive testing protocols from the start rather than as an afterthought
4. **Performance Specifications**: Document specific, measurable performance requirements (T-2.4.5 included sub-100ms specifications)

### Additional Implementation Needs

**Fresh Requirements for T-2.4.6**:
- **Fluid Typography Documentation**: Modern CSS techniques like `clamp()` for responsive scaling
- **Typography Performance**: Document performance implications of custom fonts and responsive scaling
- **Accessibility Typography**: Screen reader compatibility, dyslexia considerations, high contrast requirements
- **Typography Testing**: Automated testing for font loading, scaling validation, accessibility compliance

### Key Files and Locations

- `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced.md` - T-2.4.5 testing protocol (reference for T-2.4.6 testing approach)
- T-2.4.5 documentation files - Proven architecture pattern to replicate

**Legacy Pattern References**:
- `aplio-legacy/scss/_typography.scss` lines 16-31: Font size scaling patterns
- `aplio-legacy/scss/_typography.scss` lines 16-31: Heading responsive behavior
- `aplio-legacy/scss/_typography.scss` lines 16-31: Line height adjustments
- `aplio-legacy/scss/_typography.scss` lines 16-31: Fluid typography techniques

### Next Steps

1. **Begin T-2.4.6 Preparation Phase**: Analyze legacy typography patterns in `_typography.scss:16-31`
2. **Establish Documentation Architecture**: Create 5-file structure following T-2.4.5 successful pattern
3. **Legacy Pattern Analysis**: Extract and document responsive typography patterns with 100% accuracy
4. **Cross-Reference Planning**: Identify integration points with existing T-2.4.2 and T-2.4.5 documentation
5. **Testing Strategy Development**: Adapt T-2.4.5 comprehensive testing approach for typography validation

### Important Dependencies

**Critical for T-2.4.6 Success**:
- **Legacy File Access**: `aplio-legacy/scss/_typography.scss` must be accessible and accurate
- **Documentation Directory Structure**: `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/responsive/typography/` directory creation
- **Cross-Reference Dependencies**: T-2.4.2 components and T-2.4.5 touch documentation for integration

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The second context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)
- The third context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v3.js` (created when the second got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Add Structured Test Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js test-approach
