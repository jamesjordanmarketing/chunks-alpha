# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-07-08 15:10 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]

**T-3.2.4: Accordion Testing Infrastructure Completion**

We are currently completing the **T-3.2.4 Performance Optimization and Comprehensive Testing** task for the Accordion component. The task has progressed through the **Implementation Phase (COMPLETED)** and is now in the **Test Infrastructure Remediation Phase** to achieve 90% test coverage compliance.

**What is being worked on:**
- Fixing critical test infrastructure issues preventing 90% coverage achievement
- Resolving jsdom focus management problems blocking accessibility tests
- Completing comprehensive test suite validation for accordion components
- Ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance through automated testing

**Why it is being worked on:**
- T-3.2.4 requires 90% test coverage across statements, branches, functions, and lines
- Current coverage is only 65-68% due to test environment configuration issues
- 48 out of 81 tests are failing due to DOM environment and focus management problems
- This is a critical blocker preventing task completion and progression to T-3.2.5

**Current state of implementation:**
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Performance optimizations (React.memo, memoization, lazy loading)
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive test suite creation (81 total tests)
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Accessibility test framework setup
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Test environment configuration causing 48 test failures
- ❌ **BLOCKED**: Coverage below 90% threshold due to infrastructure issues

**Critical context needed for continuation:**
- All performance optimization code is implemented and working
- Test infrastructure has specific DOM environment issues documented below
- Four-phase immediate action plan created for systematic resolution
- Completion checklist established with clear success criteria

### Current Active Action 

**Task ID:** T-3.2.4  
**Title:** Accordion Performance Optimization and Comprehensive Testing  
**Current Phase:** Test Infrastructure Remediation (post-Validation)  
**Active Element:** ELE-1 Testing Environment Setup & VAL-1 Coverage Validation  
**Last Recorded Action:** Executed complete Validation Phase, identified critical test infrastructure issues requiring systematic fixes before task completion

### Bugs & Challenges in the Current Task

**1. Critical: Test Coverage Below 90% Requirement**
- **Issue:** Current coverage: 65.25% statements, 54.78% branches, 68.18% functions (need 90%)
- **Status:** Root cause identified - test environment issues preventing proper test execution
- **Attempted Solutions:** Enhanced Jest configuration, improved mocking setup
- **Blocking Factors:** AccordionFocusManager (37.5%) and AccordionProvider (53.12%) critically low coverage

**2. Critical: jsdom Focus Management Failures**
- **Issue:** `document.activeElement` returns `<body>` instead of focused button elements
- **Status:** Identified as jsdom limitation with insufficient mock implementation
- **Attempted Solutions:** Basic focus event mocking, enhanced Jest setup
- **Blocking Factors:** 48 test failures related to keyboard navigation and focus management

**3. Critical: DOM Environment Configuration Issues**
- **Issue:** Window object properties, event handling, and CSS computed styles not properly mocked
- **Status:** Test environment not properly simulating real DOM interactions
- **Attempted Solutions:** Basic window mocking, ResizeObserver mocking
- **Blocking Factors:** Animation tests, content rendering tests, accessibility tests failing

**4. Critical: Content Rendering and Text Matching Issues**
- **Issue:** Long text content not rendering properly, causing "Unable to find element" errors
- **Status:** CSS transitions and content expansion not working in test environment
- **Attempted Solutions:** Basic waitFor implementation, content visibility checks
- **Blocking Factors:** Dynamic content height tests and performance measurement tests failing

### Next Steps 

**1. Phase 1: Fix Test Environment (Priority 1)**
- **Action:** Update `jest.setup.T-3.2.4.js` with enhanced jsdom focus management
- **Dependencies:** None - infrastructure fix
- **Expected Outcome:** `document.activeElement` properly updates during focus events

**2. Phase 2: Fix Test Coverage (Priority 1)**
- **Action:** Add comprehensive tests for AccordionFocusManager and AccordionProvider uncovered paths
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1 completion for focus management tests
- **Expected Outcome:** >90% coverage across statements, branches, functions, lines

**3. Phase 3: Fix Content Testing (Priority 2)**
- **Action:** Implement flexible text matching and disable CSS transitions for tests
- **Dependencies:** Test environment fixes from Phase 1
- **Expected Outcome:** Dynamic content and performance tests passing

**4. Phase 4: Validate Complete Coverage (Priority 1)**
- **Action:** Run full test suite validation and generate compliance report
- **Dependencies:** Phases 1-3 completion
- **Expected Outcome:** All 81 tests passing with >90% coverage across all metrics

**5. Complete T-3.2.4 and Update Task Status**
- **Action:** Mark task complete and update project memory with final results
- **Dependencies:** Phase 4 validation success
- **Expected Outcome:** T-3.2.4 completion enabling progression to T-3.2.5

  - Accessibility testing requires enhanced DOM API mocking for proper validation
- **Technical Context**: 
  - All component implementations are complete and functionally correct
  - Test failures are infrastructure-related, not implementation-related
  - Coverage gaps concentrated in AccordionFocusManager and AccordionProvider
  - Immediate action plan provides specific code solutions for each infrastructure issue

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
```bash
node system/management/carryover-command.js
```
