=========================Prompt=For=Building=Context=========================================
You are tasked with updating the context carryover file at:
pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-07-31-25-520pm.md

First, read the entire file to understand its current structure and content.

Then, update the "Current Focus" section with the following requirements:

1. **Active Development Focus**
   - Be explicit about the task
   - Include full paths where applicable

You are not going to execute the below. Your task is to update: pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-07-31-25-520pm.md with the details of what I am requesting below:

AS per the prompt instruction you have been updating this specification pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01.md in the following way following these instructions:pmc\system\plans\context-carries\context-history\context-carry-info-07-31-25-418pm.md

It did this successfully.

But the problem is that it tried to do the next step which was: combine pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01.md with pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01b.md

So that:
`
1. The full spec has all of the tasks from both files

2. The new Content Analysis spec in pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01b.md

upgrades the Content Analysis spec in pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01.md

3. Make sure to remove any duplicate steps or instructions

4. Make sure to number everything correctly in build sequence

5. Put the updated spec in pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01c.md"`

THe problem is that it tried that last update twice and both times it said "Output is too long, please enter 'Continue' to get more."

So in the next chat window we need to:
Take both of the attempted updates which are here:
pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01c-1.md
and here
pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01c-2.md

1. Evaluate both incomplete output files:
pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01c-1.md
and
pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01c-2.md

2. Evaluate combine them, keep everything needed from both of them and remove any duplicate steps, actions, or knowlege.

3. Read the original: pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01.md instructions to make sure nothing is left out.
- Finish the final version which you will put here:
pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01d.md


Your task for this prompt is to create a prompt that will be used by the next chat agent to execute the final step of the update.


In the next carryover file: pmc/system/plans/context-carries/context-carry-info-07-31-25-520pm.md write a spec to get this done. Delete any sections which are not relevant.


2. **Section Updates**
   - REQUIRED sections must always be included and fully populated
   - CONDITIONAL sections should only be included if relevant criteria are met
   - You MUST remove any sections marked CONDITIONAL if you don't update those sections because they don't have relevant content
   - Maintain consistent formatting within each section

3. **Content Requirements**
   - All file paths must be from workspace root
   - All task IDs must include both ID and title
   - All descriptions must be specific and actionable
   - All next steps must include clear success criteria

4. **Context Preservation**
   - Include any critical context from the current session
   - Reference relevant documentation and specifications
   - Maintain links between related tasks and components
   - Document any decisions or changes that affect future work


After updating the sections, review the entire file to ensure:
1. All REQUIRED sections are present and complete
2. All CONDITIONAL sections are either properly populated or removed
3. All formatting is consistent
4. All references and links are valid
5. The context is sufficient for a new session to continue the work
