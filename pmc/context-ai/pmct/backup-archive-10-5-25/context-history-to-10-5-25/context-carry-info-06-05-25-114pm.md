# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-05 12:15 PST (Updated from chat session)
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.1.0 (incremented due to T-1.1.4 testing session analysis)

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus
**1. What is being worked on:**
Completing the comprehensive testing protocol for **Task T-1.1.4 ("Loading and Error States Implementation")** as outlined in `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2.md`. The focus is on finishing **Phase 4: LLM Vision Analysis** and **Phase 5: Validation & Reporting** which were partially completed but not finished in the previous session.

**2. Why it is being worked on:**
To ensure robust validation of loading and error state implementation for T-1.1.4 components through the complete 5-phase testing protocol including LLM Vision analysis for comprehensive component validation. The previous session revealed that while Phase 3 (Visual Testing) was largely complete, Phase 4 (LLM Vision Analysis) failed due to technical issues.

**3. Current state of implementation:**
- **PHASE 1 & 2: COMPLETE** - Jest configuration fixed, unit tests functional, component discovery complete
- **PHASE 3: LARGELY COMPLETE** - 27 screenshots exist from previous sessions, enhanced scaffolds generated
- **PHASE 4: FAILED/INCOMPLETE** - Only 1 partial LLM Vision analysis completed due to path resolution bugs
- **PHASE 5: INCOMPLETE** - Testing report creation attempted but file not actually created

**Critical context needed for continuation:**
- Work within `aplio-modern-1/` directory
- LLM Vision Analyzer has path resolution issues (looking for T-1.1.3 instead of T-1.1.4)
- Enhanced scaffolding system functional but some components have SSR rendering issues
- Test server confirmed running on port 3333

### Current Active Action 
**Task ID**: T-1.1.4 - Loading and Error States Implementation
**Current Phase**: Phase 4 (LLM Vision Analysis) - FAILED in previous session
**Active Elements**: 
- DashboardStats (Server Component) - 1 partial analysis completed
- ErrorBoundary (Client Component) - Analysis failed due to path issues
- LoadingTestUtils (Client Component) - Not attempted
- ErrorTestUtils (Client Component) - Not attempted

**Last Recorded Action**: Attempted LLM Vision Analysis but failed due to path resolution bug in analyzer looking for T-1.1.3 directory instead of T-1.1.4

### Bugs & Challenges in the Current Task
**1. LLM Vision Analyzer Path Resolution Bug**
- **Issue**: Analyzer incorrectly looks for screenshots in `test/screenshots/T-1.1.3/` instead of `test/screenshots/T-1.1.4/`
- **Status**: BLOCKING - Prevents completion of Phase 4
- **Attempted Solutions**: Multiple command variations tried, none successful
- **Blocking Factors**: Need to investigate LLM Vision analyzer code to fix path resolution

**2. Enhanced Scaffold SSR Rendering Issues**
- **Issue**: Some components (DashboardStats, LoadingTestUtils) have React SSR errors during scaffold generation
- **Status**: PARTIAL - Scaffolds created but with rendering warnings
- **Attempted Solutions**: Components rendered despite errors
- **Blocking Factors**: Not blocking but affects scaffold quality

**3. Testing Report Creation Failure**
- **Issue**: Previous session claimed to create `test/reports/T-1.1.4-testing-report.md` but file doesn't exist
- **Status**: BLOCKING for Phase 5 completion
- **Attempted Solutions**: File creation attempted via edit_file tool
- **Blocking Factors**: Tool execution issue - file wasn't actually created

### Next Steps 
1. **Action Identifier**: Fix LLM Vision Analyzer Path Resolution
   **Brief description**: Debug and fix the path resolution bug in LLM Vision analyzer that looks for T-1.1.3 instead of T-1.1.4
   **Dependencies**: Access to `test/utils/vision/enhanced-llm-vision-analyzer.js`
   **Expected outcome**: Analyzer correctly targets T-1.1.4 directory

2. **Action Identifier**: Complete Phase 4 LLM Vision Analysis for All T-1.1.4 Components
   **Brief description**: Execute Step 4.2 from testing protocol for DashboardStats, ErrorBoundary, LoadingTestUtils, ErrorTestUtils
   **Dependencies**: Path resolution bug fixed
   **Expected outcome**: 4 comprehensive LLM Vision analysis reports with â‰¥95% confidence scores

3. **Action Identifier**: Generate Phase 5 Comprehensive Testing Report
   **Brief description**: Create actual `test/reports/T-1.1.4-testing-report.md` with complete analysis
   **Dependencies**: Phase 4 completion
   **Expected outcome**: Human-readable testing report for validation

4. **Action Identifier**: Investigate Enhanced Scaffold SSR Issues
   **Brief description**: Review and potentially fix React SSR rendering issues in DashboardStats and LoadingTestUtils
   **Dependencies**: None - can be done in parallel
   **Expected outcome**: Clean scaffold rendering without errors

### Important Dependencies
**1. LLM Vision Analyzer Functionality**
- **Current Status**: BROKEN - Path resolution bug
- **Impact**: Blocks completion of Phase 4 and overall testing protocol

**2. Test Server on Port 3333**
- **Current Status**: CONFIRMED RUNNING
- **Impact**: Required for screenshot capture and scaffold serving

  - 27 screenshots validated from previous sessions showing comprehensive visual testing
  - 4 new enhanced scaffolds generated during session with React SSR rendering
  - Jest configuration confirmed working from previous fixes
  - Test infrastructure largely functional
- **Critical Failures**:
  - LLM Vision Analysis (Phase 4) incomplete due to path resolution bug

- **Relevant Learnings**: 
  - Enhanced scaffolding system works but has SSR compatibility issues with async components
  - LLM Vision analyzer infrastructure exists but has implementation bugs
  - Visual testing foundation is solid with 27 comprehensive screenshots
- **Technical Context**: 
  - Working in `aplio-modern-1/` directory
  - Test server running on port 3333
  - LLM Vision uses Claude Sonnet 4 API
  - Enhanced scaffold system uses real React SSR (not mock HTML)

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
