# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-05-27 12:14 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Focus

**ENHANCED LLM VISION ANALYSIS SYSTEM WITH TASK CONTEXT INTEGRATION - COMPREHENSIVE TESTING PHASE**

#### What is being worked on
We have successfully implemented an Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis System that automatically integrates current task requirements from `pmc/core/active-task.md` into component validation analysis. The system now provides task-aware component evaluation instead of generic UI assessment. **The next critical phase is comprehensive testing of this enhanced system across all component images.**

#### Why it is being worked on
The previous LLM vision analysis system was producing inaccurate assessments because it evaluated components against generic production UI standards rather than the actual task requirements. For T-1.1.3 (Server Component Implementation), components were incorrectly marked as FAIL when they were actually correctly implementing server/client architecture boundaries with intentional debug/testing features. The enhanced system with task context integration solves this by:

1. **Automatic Task Context Loading**: Reads current task requirements from `pmc/core/active-task.md`
2. **Task-Aware Validation**: Evaluates components against actual task acceptance criteria
3. **Context-Appropriate Assessment**: Distinguishes between development/testing vs production contexts
4. **Enhanced Reporting**: Generates comprehensive reports with task-specific validation reasoning

#### Current state of implementation
‚úÖ **COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATIONS:**
- Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer class with task context integration (`aplio-modern-1/test/utils/vision/enhanced-llm-vision-analyzer.js`)
- Automatic task requirements loading with robust path resolution
- Task information extraction (ID, title, description, acceptance criteria, components, scope)
- Task-contextualized validation prompts that include current task context
- Enhanced report generation with task context sections
- Backward compatibility with existing analysis methods

‚úÖ **VERIFIED FUNCTIONALITY:**
- Task context loading successfully loads T-1.1.3: Server Component Implementation
- Extracts 4 acceptance criteria and identifies scope as "Server/Client Component Architecture Implementation"
- Path resolution handles multiple directory structures with graceful fallback

üîÑ **PENDING COMPREHENSIVE TESTING:**
The enhanced system needs to be tested across all component images to validate the task-aware analysis and generate updated reports with proper task context.

#### Critical context needed for continuation
The enhanced system must be tested on ALL component images to ensure:
1. Task context is properly loaded and integrated
2. Component validation aligns with T-1.1.3 Server Component Implementation requirements
3. Reports include comprehensive task context and task-specific validation reasoning
4. Previous false negatives are corrected (components should now PASS when they meet task requirements)

**TESTING MUST BE EXECUTED USING THE ENHANCED LLM VISION ANALYSIS SYSTEM.**

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```
