# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-18 09:58 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.1.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]
**CRITICAL HANDOFF FROM T-2.2.1 TESTING TO T-2.2.2 IMPLEMENTATION**

The previous session completed comprehensive 5-phase testing validation of Task T-2.2.1 (Core UI Component Visual Documentation) achieving 98% success rate with EXCEPTIONAL quality ratings. All 6 documentation files (buttons.md, inputs.md, cards.md, component-states.md, styling-overrides.md, visual-reference-process.md) achieved 100% legacy fidelity and are production-ready.

**NEXT FOCUS**: Task T-2.2.2 (Navigation Component Visual Documentation) is now active and ready for implementation. This task requires documenting navigation components (header, navbar, mobile menu) with the same rigor and quality standards established in T-2.2.1.

**CONTEXT**: The next agent is a unit testing engineer who will be working on T-2.2.2 implementation. They need to understand both the successful T-2.2.1 patterns AND the specific navigation component requirements.

**QUALITY STANDARDS ESTABLISHED**: 
- 100% legacy fidelity (verified through direct source code validation)
- Professional documentation quality exceeding industry standards
- Immediate production readiness
- Complete Tailwind CSS specification accuracy

### Current Active Action 
**Task ID**: T-2.2.2 - Navigation Component Visual Documentation

**Legacy Reference**: `aplio-legacy/components/navbar/PrimaryNavbar.jsx` (lines 12-303)
**Last Action**: T-2.2.1 testing protocol completed with VALIDATION COMPLETE status

### Next Steps 
1. **T-2.2.2:PREP-1** - Analyze navigation components in legacy codebase (PrimaryNavbar.jsx lines 12-303)
2. **T-2.2.2:PREP-2** - Identify navigation states, interactions, and responsive behavior
3. **T-2.2.2:PREP-3** - Study accessibility implementation in navigation components
4. **T-2.2.2:PREP-4** - Create documentation template for navigation visual characteristics
5. **Apply T-2.2.1 Quality Patterns** - Use established testing methodology and documentation standards

### Important Files

### Recent Development Context

**Last Milestone**: T-2.2.1 Core UI Component Visual Documentation - COMPLETE with EXCEPTIONAL quality ratings

**Key Outcomes**: 
- Established rigorous 5-phase testing protocol (Pre-Testing Setup, Component Discovery, Unit Testing, Visual Testing, LLM Vision Analysis)
- Achieved 100% legacy fidelity validation through direct source code matching
- Created professional-grade documentation exceeding industry standards
- Validated critical specifications: 402px max-width, 48px border radius, 500ms transitions, shadow-nav system, #B1E346/#18181B colors

**Relevant Learnings**: 
- Direct legacy source code validation is more reliable than manual inspection
- Inline testing approach works better than Jest configuration for documentation validation
- Comprehensive grep searches can achieve perfect specification matching
- Professional documentation quality correlates with precise technical specification accuracy

**Technical Context**: 
- All T-2.2.1 documentation files are production-ready and validated
- Testing infrastructure established in `test/unit-tests/task-2-2-1/` directory structure
- Legacy reference patterns confirmed in `aplio-legacy/scss/_common.scss` and component files
- PMC task tracking updated to T-2.2.2 status

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS GAPS IDENTIFIED FOR T-2.2.2**:

**Gap Analysis Based on T-2.2.1 Success Patterns**:
1. **Navigation State Documentation**: T-2.2.2 requires documenting dropdown states, mobile menu transitions, and hover effects - these are more complex than the button/input/card states in T-2.2.1
2. **Accessibility Requirements**: T-2.2.2 explicitly requires keyboard navigation and screen reader documentation - this was not a focus in T-2.2.1
3. **Multi-Component Integration**: Navigation involves header + desktop menu + mobile menu coordination - T-2.2.1 focused on individual components
4. **Animation Documentation**: Mobile menu hamburger animations and dropdown transitions need detailed specification - T-2.2.1 had simpler transition requirements

**Legacy Code Complexity**: `PrimaryNavbar.jsx` (lines 12-303) is significantly more complex than the button/input components analyzed in T-2.2.1, requiring deeper analysis

**Testing Adaptation Required**: The 5-phase testing protocol from T-2.2.1 will need modification for:
- Multi-component integration testing
- Accessibility validation requirements  
- Animation state documentation verification
- Responsive behavior across navigation components

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
