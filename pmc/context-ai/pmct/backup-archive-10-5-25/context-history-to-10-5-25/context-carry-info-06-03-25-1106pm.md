# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-03 23:06 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]

**T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Comprehensive Automated Testing**

We are currently executing comprehensive automated testing for T-1.1.4 (Loading and Error States Implementation) following the detailed testing protocol defined in `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2.md`. This testing initiative follows a structured 5-phase protocol (Phase 0-5) and targets 15 testable components across two main implementation elements:

**Target Components:**
- **T-1.1.4:ELE-1 (Loading States)**: 5 server components (AuthLoading, LoginLoading, SignupLoading, MarketingLoading, AboutLoading)
- **T-1.1.4:ELE-2 (Error Handling)**: 5 client components (AuthError, LoginError, SignupError, MarketingError, AboutError) plus ErrorBoundary
- **Infrastructure Components**: LoadingTestUtils, ErrorTestUtils, DashboardStats, DashboardHomePage

**Testing Progress Completed:**
1. **Phase 0 - Environment Setup**: Successfully configured testing environment with Jest, Playwright, and React Testing Library dependencies verified
2. **Phase 1 - Component Discovery**: Discovered and documented all 15 testable components with comprehensive analysis
3. **Phase 2 - Unit Testing Setup**: Created comprehensive test files:
   - `loading-components.test.tsx`: Tests for all loading state components
   - `error-components.test.tsx`: Tests for error handling and ErrorBoundary functionality
   - `suspense-integration.test.tsx`: Tests for async/Suspense integration patterns

**Current Implementation State:**
- Component discovery and documentation: **COMPLETED**
- Test infrastructure creation: **COMPLETED** 
- Unit test execution: **IN PROGRESS** (encountered Jest pattern matching issue)
- Visual testing (Phase 3): **PENDING**
- LLM Vision Analysis (Phase 4): **PENDING**
- Final reporting (Phase 5): **PENDING**

**Critical Context:**
The testing follows the 736-line comprehensive testing protocol from `active-task-unit-tests-2.md` which includes specialized scaffolds, React SSR engine integration, and visual report generation. All components are successfully implemented and documented, with testing infrastructure in place but requiring Jest configuration resolution to proceed.

### Current Active Action 

Complete the unit testing of Task T-1.1.4 as per the instructions in: pmc\core\active-task-unit-tests-2.md

**Task ID:** T-1.1.4 (Loading and Error States Implementation)
**Current Phase:** Phase 2 - Unit Testing Implementation
**Active Element:** Jest test execution for all 15 components
**Last Recorded Action:** Created comprehensive unit test files but encountered Jest pattern matching issue when running `npm test -- --testPathPattern="T-1.1.4"` which requires resolution before proceeding to visual testing phases.

### Bugs & Challenges in the Current Task

**Issue:** Jest Pattern Matching Configuration
- **Description:** Jest test execution failing with pattern matching issue when targeting T-1.1.4 test files
- **Current Status:** Blocking progression to Phase 3-5 of testing protocol
- **Attempted Solutions:** Created test files with proper naming conventions following project structure
- **Blocking Factors:** Jest configuration may need adjustment for pattern matching or alternative test execution approach required

### Next Steps 

1. **Resolve Jest Configuration Issue**
   - Action: Debug and fix Jest pattern matching for T-1.1.4 test execution
   - Dependencies: Jest configuration in package.json or jest.config.js
   - Expected Outcome: Successful unit test execution for all 15 components

2. **Execute Phase 3 - Visual Testing**
   - Action: Generate visual reports using Playwright testing infrastructure
   - Dependencies: Unit tests passing successfully
   - Expected Outcome: Visual validation reports for loading and error states

3. **Implement Phase 4 - LLM Vision Analysis**
   - Action: Run LLM Vision analysis on component screenshots per testing protocol
   - Dependencies: Visual reports generated successfully
   - Expected Outcome: AI-powered visual analysis reports

4. **Complete Phase 5 - Final Reporting**
   - Action: Generate comprehensive testing report with all phase results
   - Dependencies: All previous phases completed
   - Expected Outcome: Complete T-1.1.4 testing validation report

5. **Update Task Status to Complete**
   - Action: Mark T-1.1.4 testing as completed in PMC system
   - Dependencies: All testing phases successfully executed
   - Expected Outcome: T-1.1.4 ready for production deployment

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
```bash
node system/management/carryover-command.js
```
