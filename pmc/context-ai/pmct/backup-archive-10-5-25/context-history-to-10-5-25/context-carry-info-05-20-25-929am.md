# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-05-20 09:29 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]
We are conducting an audit of the automated test results for T-1.1.3: Server Component Implementation. The primary goal is to verify that the AI testing agent has successfully validated that all components meet the requirements for:

1. Element ELE-1: Server component implementation for non-interactive parts
2. Element ELE-2: Client component boundaries with 'use client' directive

The testing process involved:
- Creating test files for verifying server and client component patterns
- Setting up test scaffolds for components to be visually inspected
- Capturing screenshots of components using Playwright
- Running Jest tests to verify component implementation

Based on examination of the test artifacts, there are several concerns that need investigation:
1. The screenshots (7 PNG files in test/screenshots/T-1.1.3/) were captured, but there's no evidence that AI vision models were used to evaluate them
2. The capture-results.json file only contains success status and file paths, without any actual evaluation data
3. The test-T-1.1.3-report.md indicates configuration issues prevented some tests from running properly
4. It's unclear if the screenshots actually show rendered components or just empty pages

We need to determine whether the testing was properly completed and if the components actually meet the requirements for T-1.1.3.

### Next Steps 
1. **Verify Component Screenshots**: Open and visually inspect the 7 component screenshots in `aplio-modern-1/test/screenshots/T-1.1.3/` to confirm if they show properly rendered components
2. **Run Tests Manually**: Execute the Jest tests with proper configuration to verify server and client component implementations
3. **Examine Test Server**: Check if the test server at http://localhost:3333 is properly serving component scaffolds
4. **Verify Component Implementation**: Manually review the actual component code in `aplio-modern-1/app/_components/` to confirm proper server/client boundaries

### Aplio Design System Modernization Project

#### Project Overview
This project aims to transform the existing JavaScript-based Aplio theme into a modern TypeScript-powered Next.js 14 platform. The project specifically focuses on migrating the Home 4 template (https://js-aplio-6.vercel.app/home-4) as the flagship demonstration while preserving Aplio's premium design aesthetics from the existing design system in `/aplio-legacy/`.

#### Key Documents
1. Seed Story: `pmc/product/00-aplio-mod-1-seed-story.md`
2. Project Overview: `pmc/product/00-aplio-mod-1-seed-narrative.md`
3. Raw Data: `pmc/product/_seeds/00-narrative-raw_data-ts-14-v3.md`

#### Project Objectives

##### Primary Goals
1. Migrate Home 4 template to Next.js 14 App Router architecture
2. Preserve exact design elements from `/aplio-legacy/`
3. Implement TypeScript with full type safety
4. Maintain premium design quality and animations

##### Technical Requirements
1. Next.js 14 App Router implementation
2. Complete TypeScript migration
3. Modern component architecture
4. Performance optimization

##### Design Requirements
1. Exact preservation of design elements from `/aplio-legacy/`
2. Maintenance of animation quality
3. Responsive behavior preservation
4. Professional template implementation

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
```bash
node system/management/carryover-command.js
```
