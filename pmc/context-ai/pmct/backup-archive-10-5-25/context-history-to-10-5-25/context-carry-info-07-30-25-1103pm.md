# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-07-30 23:03 PST
**Project:** Pipeline State Management System Documentation Enhancement
**Context Version:** 3.1.0

## Introduction

This context document focuses on creating a comprehensive, authoritative guide for AI coding agents on how to use the Pipeline State Management System (T-1.1.1). The current documentation exists in multiple versions with varying levels of detail and structure, requiring consolidation into a definitive v2 specification.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**Primary Task**: Create comprehensive Pipeline State Management System documentation (v2)

**What is being worked on**: 
- Consolidating pipeline state documentation from multiple sources into a single authoritative guide
- Creating `pmc/docs/ltc-6a/utility-how-to-use-pipeline-state-v2.md`
- Enhancing the existing v1 documentation with detailed implementation patterns from v0.1 unstructured version

**Why it is being worked on**: 
- Current v1 documentation lacks the comprehensive detail and specific implementation guidance found in the v0.1 unstructured version
- AI coding agents need precise, actionable instructions with exact file paths, code patterns, and integration requirements
- The pipeline state management system (T-1.1.1) is critical for ensuring work progress persistence and real-time tracking across all application components

**Current state of implementation**: 
- v0.1 unstructured version contains detailed implementation patterns and specific code examples
- v1 version provides good structure but lacks the comprehensive detail needed for coding agents
- v2 version needs to be created by combining the best elements of both versions

**Critical context needed for continuation**: 
- Task reference: T-1.1.1: Pipeline State Management System
- Parent task: T-1.1.0: Core Pipeline Engine
- Functional requirement: FR-1.1.1
- Implementation patterns: P001-PIPELINE-ORCHESTRATION, P006-WORKFLOW-ENGINE, P002-CLIENT-COMPONENT
- Core elements: ELE-1 (State Persistence), ELE-2 (Progress Tracking), ELE-3 (Error Recovery)

### Next Steps

1. **Create v2 Documentation** (`pmc/docs/ltc-6a/utility-how-to-use-pipeline-state-v2.md`)
   - Consolidate detailed implementation patterns from v0.1 unstructured version
   - Maintain clear structure from v1 version
   - Add comprehensive code examples with exact file paths
   - Include specific integration requirements for coding agents
   - Expected outcome: Authoritative guide with actionable implementation instructions

2. **Enhance Implementation Patterns Section**
   - Include exact code patterns from v0.1 for each ELE component
   - Add specific file locations with line number references
   - Provide complete integration examples for common use cases
   - Expected outcome: Coding agents can implement pipeline state management without ambiguity

3. **Add Comprehensive API Integration Guidelines**
   - Include WebSocket/SSE implementation patterns from v0.1
   - Add real-time synchronization examples
   - Provide error handling and recovery mechanisms
   - Expected outcome: Complete API integration specification

4. **Create Development Workflow Templates**
   - Add step-by-step implementation checklist
   - Include testing requirements and patterns
   - Provide performance optimization guidelines
   - Expected outcome: Standardized development approach for all components

5. **Validate Documentation Completeness**
   - Ensure all mandatory references are included
   - Verify code examples are complete and accurate
   - Test implementation patterns against existing codebase
   - Expected outcome: Production-ready documentation for coding agents

### Important Files

1. **Source Documentation Files**:
   - `pmc/docs/ltc-6a/utility-how-to-use-pipeline-state-v01-unstructured.md` - Contains detailed implementation patterns and comprehensive code examples
   - `pmc/docs/ltc-6a/utility-how-to-use-pipeline-state-v1.md` - Provides structured format but lacks comprehensive detail

2. **Target Documentation File**:
   - `pmc/docs/ltc-6a/utility-how-to-use-pipeline-state-v2.md` - To be created as authoritative guide

3. **Reference Implementation Files**:
   - `pmc/product/05-bmo-implementation-patterns.md` - Contains P001-PIPELINE-ORCHESTRATION and related patterns
   - `pmc/product/06b-aplio-mod-1-tasks-built.md` - Contains T-1.1.1 task specifications
   - `pmc/product/03-bmo-functional-requirements.md` - Contains FR-1.1.1 requirements

### Important Scripts, Markdown Files, and Specifications

1. **Implementation Patterns Reference**:
   - `pmc/product/05-bmo-implementation-patterns.md` (lines 300-400) - P006-WORKFLOW-ENGINE pattern
   - `pmc/product/05-bmo-implementation-patterns.md` (lines 101-200) - P002-CLIENT-COMPONENT pattern
   - Purpose: Provides specific implementation patterns that must be referenced in v2 documentation

2. **Task Specifications**:
   - `pmc/product/06b-aplio-mod-1-tasks-built.md` - T-1.1.1 complete specifications
   - Purpose: Contains exact implementation locations, components, and requirements
   - Key sections: Task definition, ELE components, implementation process

3. **Functional Requirements**:
