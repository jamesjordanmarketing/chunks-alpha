# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-07 11:59 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.1.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]
**Transition from Infrastructure Testing to Component Implementation**

The project has successfully completed comprehensive infrastructure testing for **T-1.2.1: TypeScript Configuration Setup** and is now transitioning to **T-1.2.2: Component Type Definitions**. This represents a critical shift from infrastructure validation to active component development.

**What is being worked on:**
- T-1.2.2: Component Type Definitions (Pattern P005-COMPONENT-TYPES)
- Creating comprehensive TypeScript type definitions for component props and state
- Establishing reusable type patterns for the Aplio Design System components

**Why it is being worked on:**
- T-1.2.1 infrastructure testing confirmed all TypeScript configuration is fully functional
- Enhanced strict mode configuration is working perfectly (detecting 59 type safety issues as expected)
- TypeScript compilation, ESLint integration, and path aliases are all validated
- Component type definitions are the next logical step to leverage the validated TypeScript infrastructure

**Current state of implementation:**
- T-1.2.1 has COMPLETED comprehensive infrastructure testing with 100% success rate
- All testing artifacts have been generated and documented
- T-1.2.2 is ready for immediate implementation with validated TypeScript infrastructure
- Legacy code references have been identified for component props and state patterns

**Critical context needed for continuation:**
- Enhanced TypeScript configuration provides 6 additional strict mode options beyond basic strict
- Path aliases system supports 9 configured patterns (@/*, @/components/*, etc.)
- ESLint with TypeScript integration is fully functional with modern flat config
- Testing framework (Jest) is validated and ready for component type testing
- Legacy component references: Hero.jsx (props) and FaqItem.jsx (state) need analysis

### Next Steps 
1. **T-1.2.2:PREP-1** - Analyze component props across the application by examining legacy Hero.jsx references
2. **T-1.2.2:PREP-2** - Identify state patterns in components by examining legacy FaqItem.jsx patterns  
3. **T-1.2.2:IMP-1** - Create shared component type definitions in `/aplio-modern-1/types/components/`
4. **T-1.2.2:IMP-2** - Implement interface patterns for component props with TypeScript strict mode validation
5. **T-1.2.2:VAL-1** - Verify component prop type definitions using validated testing infrastructure

### Important Dependencies
**TypeScript Infrastructure Dependency (RESOLVED)**
- **Dependency**: Enhanced TypeScript configuration with strict mode and path aliases
- **Status**: ✅ FULLY VALIDATED - All infrastructure testing passed
- **Impact**: Enables immediate component type development with full strict mode support

**ESLint TypeScript Integration (RESOLVED)**  
- **Dependency**: ESLint flat config with TypeScript presets
- **Status**: ✅ FULLY VALIDATED - Modern flat config operational
- **Impact**: Provides real-time type checking during component development

### Important Files
1. **aplio-modern-1/tsconfig.json** - Enhanced TypeScript configuration (validated functional)
2. **aplio-modern-1/eslint.config.mjs** - ESLint TypeScript integration (validated functional)
3. **pmc/core/active-task.md** - T-1.2.2 implementation specifications
4. **aplio-legacy/components/home-4/Hero.jsx:5-15** - Legacy component props reference
5. **aplio-legacy/components/shared/FaqItem.jsx:5-10** - Legacy component state reference
6. **aplio-modern-1/types/components/** - Target directory for type definitions (to be created)

### Important Scripts, Markdown Files, and Specifications
1. **aplio-modern-1/test/reports/T-1.2.1-FINAL-TESTING-COMPLETION-REPORT.md** - Infrastructure testing validation results
2. **aplio-modern-1/test/T-1.2.1-TESTING-LINKS-AND-ARTIFACTS.md** - Complete testing artifacts reference
3. **pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2.md** - Testing protocol reference for future testing needs
4. **aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-1-2.1/T-1.2.1/typescript-config-validation.test.ts** - Infrastructure validation test example

### Recent Development Context

**Last Milestone**: Completed comprehensive infrastructure testing for T-1.2.1: TypeScript Configuration Setup

**Key Outcomes**: 
- ✅ Enhanced TypeScript strict mode configuration fully functional (6 additional strict options active)
- ✅ All 9 path alias patterns validated and operational (@/*, @/components/*, @/lib/*, etc.)
- ✅ ESLint TypeScript integration confirmed with modern flat config format
- ✅ Jest testing framework validated and ready for component testing
- ✅ TypeScript compilation detecting expected type safety issues (59 issues found - this is correct behavior)

**Relevant Learnings**: 
- Infrastructure testing pattern proved highly effective for validating complex TypeScript configurations
- Enhanced strict mode configuration provides significantly more type safety than basic strict mode
- Manual validation tests can supplement automated Jest testing when needed
- Testing artifacts documentation is crucial for handoff between agents

**Technical Context**: 
- TypeScript 5.8.3 with enhanced strict mode configuration active
- Jest 29.7.0 validated for component testing
- ESLint 8.57.1 with TypeScript plugin integration functional
- Next.js 15 compatibility maintained throughout TypeScript configuration
- Development environment: aplio-modern-1 directory with full TypeScript infrastructure

### Aplio Design System Modernization Project

#### Project Overview
This project aims to transform the existing JavaScript-based Aplio theme into a modern TypeScript-powered Next.js 14 platform. The project specifically focuses on migrating the Home 4 template (https://js-aplio-6.vercel.app/home-4) as the flagship demonstration while preserving Aplio's premium design aesthetics from the existing design system in `/aplio-legacy/`.

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
