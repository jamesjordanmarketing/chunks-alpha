# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-07-31 16:18 PST
**Project:** Bright Run LoRA Training Data Platform - Content Analysis Engine Reorganization
**Context Version:** 4.0.0

## Introduction

This context document focuses on the reorganization and implementation of the Content Analysis Engine (T-1.2.0) for the Bright Run LoRA Training Data Platform. The project involves restructuring the current task specification to prioritize user interface development, integrate pipeline state management, and then implement the core content analysis functionality.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**Primary Objective**: Reorganize and create a new specification for T-1.2.0: Content Analysis Engine that prioritizes UI development and state management integration before implementing core analysis functionality.

**What is being worked on**: 
- Creating a comprehensive task reorganization specification for T-1.2.0: Content Analysis Engine
- Restructuring the implementation approach to follow a UI-first methodology
- Integrating Pipeline State Management System (T-1.1.1) into the content analysis workflow
- Defining clear task ordering and dependencies for the next development phase

**Why it is being worked on**:
- Current T-1.2.0 specification lacks user interface components and state management integration
- Need to establish a solid UI foundation before implementing complex analysis algorithms
- Pipeline State Management System must be integrated to ensure workflow continuity and error recovery
- Better user experience requires building the interface first, then connecting backend functionality

**Current state of implementation**:
- Base specification exists in `pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01.md`
- UI prototypes available in `pmc\product\_front-end\content-upload` and `pmc\product\_front-end\content-dash`
- Pipeline State Management System v2 documentation completed at `pmc\docs\ltc-6a\utility-how-to-use-pipeline-state-v2.md`
- Ready to create reorganized specification at `pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01b.md`

**Critical context needed for continuation**:
- The next agent must be a senior software engineering agent capable of task specification and reorganization
- Must maintain the same task numbering system (T-1.2.0) and element structure (ELE-1, ELE-2, ELE-3)
- Must integrate all three phases: UI development, state management integration, and content analysis implementation
- Must reference the v3 pipeline state management documentation (note: user mentioned v3, but current file is v2)

### Next Steps

3. **UI-PHASE-2**: Define content dashboard development task
   - **Source**: `pmc\product\_front-end\content-dash` (all code files and JPG)
   - **Dependencies**: Upload page completion and state management integration
   - **Expected Outcome**: Detailed task specification for dashboard with state management

4. **STATE-INTEGRATION**: Define pipeline state management integration tasks
   - **Reference**: `pmc\docs\ltc-6a\utility-how-to-use-pipeline-state-v2.md` (or v3 if available)
   - **Dependencies**: UI pages defined in phases 1 and 2
   - **Expected Outcome**: Clear integration specifications for both UI pages

5. **ANALYSIS-IMPLEMENTATION**: Reorganize core content analysis functionality
   - **Source**: Current T-1.2.1, T-1.2.2, T-1.2.3 specifications
   - **Dependencies**: UI and state management foundations completed
   - **Expected Outcome**: Updated analysis tasks that integrate with established UI framework
