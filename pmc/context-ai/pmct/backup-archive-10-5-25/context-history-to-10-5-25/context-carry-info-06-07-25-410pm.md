# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-07 16:10 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]
**UNIT TESTING PHASE FOR T-1.2.2: Component Type Definitions**

We have completed the implementation of T-1.2.2 (Component Type Definitions) and need to proceed to comprehensive unit testing. The task created a complete TypeScript type system for component props and state management, but the testing requirements have not yet been fulfilled.

**What is being worked on:** Unit testing implementation for the completed TypeScript component type definitions.

**Why it is being worked on:** The task requires comprehensive unit testing with specific requirements:
- Test Location: `aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-1-2/T-1.2.2/`
- Testing Tools: Jest, TypeScript, ts-jest, dtslint
- Test Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage
- Need to validate all type definitions work correctly in real-world scenarios

**Current state:** Implementation is 100% complete with all phases (PREP, IMP, VAL) finished. However, no formal unit tests have been created in the designated test directory structure. A compilation validation test exists but formal Jest unit tests are missing.

**Critical context for continuation:**
1. All TypeScript type definitions compile successfully 
2. Types have been integrated into existing components (Button, Card, FaqItem)
3. Comprehensive type system spans 5 main files with specialized categories
4. Next task (T-1.2.3) depends on this task being fully complete including testing
5. Testing gap identified: No Jest unit tests in required test directory structure

### Current Active Action 
**Task ID:** T-1.2.2
**Task Title:** Component Type Definitions
**Current Phase:** Testing Phase (Post-Implementation)
**Active Element:** Unit Test Implementation Required
**Last Recorded Action:** [06/07/2025, 01:28:28 PM] Completed T-1.2.2 Component Type Definitions - All phases (PREP, IMP, VAL) successfully completed with comprehensive TypeScript type system (Confidence: 10/10)

### Bugs & Challenges in the Current Task
**TESTING GAP IDENTIFIED:**
1. **Issue:** No Jest unit tests created in required test directory `aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-1-2/T-1.2.2/`
2. **Current Status:** Task marked as complete but testing requirements not fulfilled
3. **Attempted Solutions:** Only TypeScript compilation validation was performed
4. **Blocking Factors:** Need to create comprehensive Jest test suite to meet 90% coverage requirement

### Next Steps 
1. **Create Test Directory Structure** - Set up `aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-1-2/T-1.2.2/` with proper Jest configuration
2. **Implement Component Type Tests** - Create Jest unit tests for all type definitions covering prop types, state types, and generic patterns
3. **Coverage Validation** - Ensure 90% test coverage requirement is met using Jest coverage reporting
4. **Integration Testing** - Verify types work correctly with existing components (Button, Card, FaqItem)
5. **Complete Task Documentation** - Update task completion status once testing requirements are fulfilled

### Important Files
1. **aplio-modern-1/types/components/index.ts** - Main type definitions file with base component types, contains core interfaces
2. **aplio-modern-1/types/components/forms.ts** - Form component type definitions, requires validation testing
3. **aplio-modern-1/types/components/navigation.ts** - Navigation component types, needs integration testing
4. **aplio-modern-1/types/components/hooks.ts** - Custom hooks with full implementations, requires functional testing
5. **aplio-modern-1/types/components/generic.ts** - Generic reusable patterns, needs comprehensive type testing
6. **aplio-modern-1/types/components/validation.test.ts** - Existing TypeScript compilation validation (not Jest unit tests)

4. **pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js** - PMC CLI for task management and status updates

### Recent Development Context

**Last Milestone:** Successfully completed T-1.2.2 Component Type Definitions implementation with all acceptance criteria met

**Key Outcomes:** 
- Created comprehensive TypeScript type system across 5 specialized files
- Successfully integrated shared types into existing components
- Established polymorphic component patterns and generic reusable types
- Validated TypeScript compilation with strict mode compatibility
- All acceptance criteria fulfilled: explicit interfaces, state management types, generic patterns, consistent definitions

**Relevant Learnings:**
- TypeScript strict mode compatibility required careful interface design
- Path alias integration (`@/types/components`) works seamlessly with existing configuration
- Polymorphic component patterns enable flexible component APIs
- Custom hooks with TypeScript require careful state management type definitions

**Technical Context:**
- All type definitions compile without errors using `npx tsc --noEmit`
- LoadingState interface required signature fix for `setLoading` function
- Export conflicts resolved by removing explicit export blocks from specialized files
- Existing components successfully migrated from local types to shared type definitions

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
