# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-28 12:46 PST
**Project:** Fix ThemeSwitcher JSX Return Bug
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## You Must Focus on:

### Active Development Focus

**CRITICAL PRIORITY: Fix ThemeSwitcher JSX Return Bug**

**What is being worked on:**
We are implementing the critical JSX return bug fix for the ThemeSwitcher component as specified in `pmc/core/active-task-2.5.2-addendum-jsx-return.md`. The current component returns a string instead of proper JSX elements, causing render errors.

**Why it is being worked on:**
The ThemeSwitcher component in `aplio-modern-1/app/_components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx` currently returns a string instead of JSX, which breaks component rendering. This must be fixed to restore basic functionality.

**Current state of implementation:**
- ❌ **ThemeSwitcher Component**: Currently returns string instead of JSX - BROKEN
- ✅ **JSX Fix Specification**: Complete implementation plan exists in jsx-return addendum

**Critical context needed for continuation:**
- **JSX Return Bug**: The current ThemeSwitcher component returns a string instead of proper JSX elements
- **Implementation Plan**: Phase 1 fix plan exists in jsx-return addendum
- **Target File**: `aplio-modern-1/app/_components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx`

Do not deviate from this focus without explicit instruction.

### Next Steps 

1. **IMMEDIATE: Execute JSX Return Bug Fix - Phase 1 Only**
   - **Action:** Implement Phase 1 (Component Structure Fix) from `pmc/core/active-task-2.5.2-addendum-jsx-return.md`
   - **Dependencies:** None - JSX return bug fix specification is complete
   - **Expected Outcome:** ThemeSwitcher component returns proper JSX instead of string, eliminates render error

2. **Phase 1: Component Structure Fix (30 min)**
   - **Action:** Fix React imports, component declaration, and JSX return in `aplio-modern-1/app/_components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx`
   - **Dependencies:** JSX return bug fix specification
   - **Expected Outcome:** Component renders without string return error, basic functionality restored

3. **Basic Functionality Validation**
   - **Action:** Test that component renders properly and basic theme switching works
   - **Dependencies:** Phase 1 completion
   - **Expected Outcome:** Component displays and can toggle themes (minimal working state)

4. **Document Current State**
   - **Action:** Update task status and document that JSX bug fix is complete
   - **Dependencies:** Successful Phase 1 implementation and basic validation
   - **Expected Outcome:** Clear status update showing JSX bug resolved

5. **Hold for Further Instructions**
   - **Action:** Await instructions on whether to proceed with full Theme Switcher UI implementation
   - **Dependencies:** Completion of JSX bug fix and basic validation
   - **Expected Outcome:** Ready state for next development phase decision

### Important Files

1. **`pmc/core/active-task-2.5.2-addendum-jsx-return.md`**
   - Purpose: Complete implementation specification for JSX return bug fix
   - Current state: Complete specification ready for execution

2. **`aplio-modern-1/app/_components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx`**
   - Purpose: Broken ThemeSwitcher component requiring JSX return fix
   - Current state: Returns string instead of JSX - PRIMARY TARGET FOR FIX

### Important Scripts, Markdown Files, and Specifications

1. **`pmc/core/active-task-2.5.2-addendum-jsx-return.md`**
   - Purpose: Complete implementation plan for JSX return bug fix
   - Key sections: Phase 1 Component Structure Fix
   - Status: Ready for immediate execution

---

**FOCUS**: Fix only the JSX return bug in `aplio-modern-1/app/_components/ThemeSwitcher.tsx` per the jsx-return addendum specification. Do not implement any other features or specifications.
