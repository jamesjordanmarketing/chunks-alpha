# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-07-07 03:07 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]

**CRITICAL: T-3.2.2 AccordionItem Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol (Phases 3-5 COMPLETION)**

The current focus is completing the comprehensive testing validation for T-3.2.2 AccordionItem implementation using the enhanced 5-phase testing protocol. This task builds upon the successfully completed Phases 1-2 and must now complete Phases 3-5 to achieve full production readiness validation.

**Why this is being worked on:**
- T-3.2.2 AccordionItem is a critical UI component that provides interactive FAQ/accordion functionality
- Implementation was completed with 98% DSAP compliance and 100% unit test coverage
- Enhanced testing protocol ensures visual fidelity, integration functionality, and production readiness
- This follows the proven enhanced testing methodology established in T-3.2.1 and other successful tasks

**Current state of implementation:**
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - Phases 1 & 2**: Component discovery, classification, and comprehensive unit testing with 100% pass rate (24/24 tests)
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED - Phase 2 Validation**: All 6 acceptance criteria validated, 95%+ code coverage achieved, zero accessibility violations
- üîÑ **IN PROGRESS - Phase 3**: Visual testing scaffolds generated (18 scaffolds), screenshots capture attempted but incomplete
- ‚è≥ **PENDING - Phase 4**: Integration testing validation with AccordionProvider
- ‚è≥ **PENDING - Phase 5**: Final validation and comprehensive reporting

**Critical context for continuation:**
The next agent MUST complete Phases 3-5 of the enhanced testing protocol specifically for T-3.2.2 AccordionItem components. DO NOT test any other accordion tasks - focus ONLY on T-3.2.2 components. All infrastructure is prepared and waiting for completion.

### Current Active Action

**Task ID:** T-3.2.2 AccordionItem Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol Phases 3-5
**Current Phase:** Phase 3 (Visual Testing with Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis) - In Progress
**Active Element:** Screenshot generation and LLM vision analysis for 18 generated scaffolds
**Last Recorded Action:** Generated 18 comprehensive T-3.2.2 AccordionItem scaffolds covering all states (closed/open/disabled), viewports (desktop/tablet/mobile), and themes (light/dark). Attempted screenshot capture but encountered puppeteer execution issues.

### Bugs & Challenges in the Current Task

**Issue 1: Screenshot Capture Execution**
- **Description:** T-3.2.2-screenshot-capture.js script execution failed with puppeteer, preventing screenshot generation
- **Current Status:** 18 scaffolds ready for screenshot capture in `test/scaffolds/T-3.2.2/`
- **Attempted Solutions:** Created comprehensive screenshot capture script with proper viewport configurations
- **Blocking Factors:** Puppeteer execution environment issues - may need alternative approach or debugging

**Issue 2: LLM Vision Analysis Preparation**
- **Description:** Cannot proceed with enhanced LLM vision analysis until screenshots are captured
- **Current Status:** Enhanced LLM vision analyzer infrastructure ready and proven effective from T-3.2.1
- **Attempted Solutions:** Infrastructure verified, analyzer available at `test/utils/vision/enhanced-llm-vision-analyzer.js`
- **Blocking Factors:** Dependent on screenshot generation completion

### Next Steps

1. **Generate T-3.2.2 Screenshots** (CRITICAL - PRIORITY 1)
   - Action: Capture screenshots from 18 scaffolds in `test/scaffolds/T-3.2.2/`
   - Dependencies: Fix puppeteer execution or use alternative method

   - Action: Run enhanced LLM vision analyzer on all T-3.2.2 screenshots
   - Dependencies: Screenshots must be generated first
   - Expected Outcome: Comprehensive visual validation reports with ‚â•95% confidence

3. **Complete Phase 4 Integration Testing** (PRIORITY 3)
   - Action: Execute AccordionProvider integration testing as specified in enhanced test plan
   - Dependencies: Phase 3 completion
   - Expected Outcome: Validated single/multiple mode coordination

4. **Complete Phase 5 Final Validation** (PRIORITY 4)
   - Action: Generate comprehensive final validation report consolidating all phases
   - Dependencies: Phases 3-4 completion
   - Expected Outcome: Production readiness confirmation

5. **Update Documentation** (PRIORITY 5)

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
```bash
node system/management/carryover-command.js
