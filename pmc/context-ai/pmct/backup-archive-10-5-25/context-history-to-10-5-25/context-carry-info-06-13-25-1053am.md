# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-13 10:53 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

The Active Development Focus for the next agent is to execute comprehensive testing for Task T-1.3.3: Utility and Hook Organization, which has been fully implemented and requires thorough testing validation according to the testing protocol in `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2.md`.

**Task Context:**
- **Task ID**: T-1.3.3
- **Task Title**: Utility and Hook Organization
- **Implementation Status**: COMPLETE - All phases (PREP, IMP, VAL) finished
- **Current Need**: Execute comprehensive testing protocol per `active-task-unit-tests-2.md`

**What was implemented:**
1. **Utility Organization (ELE-1)**: Complete directory structure and TypeScript utilities
   - Styling utilities: `cn.ts`, `theme-provider.tsx`
   - Markdown utilities: `getMarkdownData.ts`, `getMarkdownContent.ts`
   - Animation utilities: `animationVariants.ts`

2. **Custom Hooks (ELE-2)**: Full suite of client-side hooks with TypeScript
   - Animation hooks: `useViewportAnimation.ts`, `useCounterAnimation.ts`
   - Theme hooks: `useTheme.ts`
   - UI state hooks: `useTabState.ts`, `useFilterState.ts`

3. **Example Components**: Demonstration components showing hook usage
   - `ThemeToggle.tsx`, `TabPanel.tsx`, `FilterableList.tsx`, `AnimatedCounter.tsx`

**Why testing is critical:**
- All utilities and hooks are production-ready but require comprehensive testing validation
- Testing protocol must verify component functionality, visual rendering, and integration
- LLM Vision analysis required for visual validation of example components
- Test coverage must meet 90% requirement specified in task

**Current state:**
- Implementation: 100% complete with all acceptance criteria met
- Basic unit tests: Created and passing (32 tests, 5 test suites)
- Enhanced testing protocol: NOT YET EXECUTED (this is the current focus)
- Visual validation: NOT YET EXECUTED
- LLM Vision analysis: NOT YET EXECUTED

### Current Active Action

**Task ID**: T-1.3.3
**Phase**: Testing Protocol Execution
**Active Element**: Execute enhanced testing protocol from `active-task-unit-tests-2.md`
**Last Recorded Action**: Implementation and basic validation completed, ready for comprehensive testing

### Next Steps

1. **Execute Phase 0**: Pre-Testing Environment Setup from `active-task-unit-tests-2.md`
   - Navigate to aplio-modern-1 directory
   - Create test directory structure for T-1.3.3
   - Start testing infrastructure (servers on ports 3333, 3334)
   - Verify system dependencies

2. **Execute Phase 1**: Component Discovery & Classification
   - Discover all testable elements in T-1.3.3 implementation
   - Document findings in `current-test-discovery.md`
   - Validate component imports and compilation

3. **Execute Remaining Phases**: Follow complete testing protocol
   - Phase 2: Unit Testing
   - Phase 3: Visual Testing with scaffolds and screenshots
   - Phase 4: LLM Vision Analysis
   - Phase 5: Reporting and validation

4. **Critical Testing Requirements NOT in active-task-unit-tests-2.md**:
   - Test framer-motion integration in animation hooks
   - Validate IntersectionObserver cleanup in useCounterAnimation
   - Test theme hydration handling in useTheme hook
   - Verify TypeScript type safety across all utilities
   - Test example components with actual user interactions

5. **Testing Steps NO LONGER NEEDED** (already completed):
   - Basic unit test creation (already done - 32 tests passing)
   - TypeScript compilation validation (already verified)
   - Directory structure creation for lib/ (already exists)

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation
