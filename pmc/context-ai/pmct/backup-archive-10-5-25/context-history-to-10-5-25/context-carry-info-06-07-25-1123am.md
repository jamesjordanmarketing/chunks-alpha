# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-07 11:23 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.1.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 15's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]

**PRIMARY FOCUS**: Unit Testing Execution for Task T-1.2.1: TypeScript Configuration Setup

The immediate focus is executing the corrected unit testing protocol for the completed TypeScript configuration setup task. Critical discovery made during testing approach analysis: T-1.2.1 is a pure infrastructure/configuration task with NO visual components requiring testing.

**CRITICAL CONTEXT CORRECTION**: The original testing protocol in `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2.md` incorrectly applies visual testing methodologies to configuration tasks. This session identified and corrected the fundamental mismatch between the testing approach and the actual nature of T-1.2.1.

**IMPLEMENTATION STATE**: Task T-1.2.1 has been fully implemented and validated. Testing approach has been corrected and documented. Ready for infrastructure-focused unit testing execution.

**KEY DISCOVERY**: T-1.2.1 elements are configuration files, not React components:
- T-1.2.1:ELE-1 - TypeScript configuration files (tsconfig.json, compiler settings)
- T-1.2.1:ELE-2 - ESLint integration files (eslint.config.mjs, rule configurations)

**TESTING PROTOCOL CORRECTIONS MADE**:
- Removed inappropriate Phase 3 (Visual Testing & Analysis) and Phase 4 (LLM Vision Analysis)  
- Replaced with infrastructure-focused testing: configuration validation, TypeScript compilation testing, ESLint rule enforcement, path alias resolution, build process compatibility
- Updated testing approach from 5-phase to 4-phase protocol appropriate for configuration validation
- Explicitly documented that Phase 3 and Phase 4 should NOT be executed per user directive

### Current Active Action 

**Task ID**: T-1.2.1: TypeScript Configuration Setup
**Current Phase**: Unit Testing Protocol Execution (Post-Implementation)
**Active Element**: Infrastructure testing preparation - corrected testing approach documented
**Last Recorded Action**: Testing approach corrected to remove visual testing phases inappropriate for configuration task. 4-phase infrastructure testing protocol finalized and ready for execution.
**Next Required Action**: Execute corrected unit testing protocol focusing on TypeScript compilation validation, ESLint rule enforcement, and path alias functionality testing.

### Next Steps 

1. **Execute Infrastructure Unit Testing Protocol** - Follow corrected 4-phase testing approach documented in `pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md`
   - Dependencies: Testing approach corrected and approved
   - Expected Outcome: Configuration validation through compilation testing and rule enforcement verification

2. **Phase 1: Environment Setup & Infrastructure** - Create test directory structure, verify Jest/TypeScript/ESLint dependencies without visual testing components  
   - Dependencies: None, basic infrastructure setup
   - Expected Outcome: Testing environment configured for configuration validation

3. **Phase 2: Configuration Discovery & Classification** - Identify T-1.2.1 configuration elements, validate configuration file syntax and structure
   - Dependencies: Phase 1 complete
   - Expected Outcome: Configuration elements documented and validated for structural integrity

4. **Phase 3: Infrastructure Testing Execution** - Test TypeScript strict mode compilation, path alias resolution, ESLint rule enforcement, build process compatibility
   - Dependencies: Phase 2 complete  
   - Expected Outcome: All configuration functionality validated through behavioral testing

5. **Phase 4: Validation & Reporting** - Generate infrastructure testing report documenting configuration effectiveness and acceptance criteria compliance
   - Dependencies: Phase 3 complete
   - Expected Outcome: Comprehensive testing documentation confirming configuration setup success

### Recent Development Context

**Last Milestone**: Testing Approach Analysis and Correction for T-1.2.1
**Key Outcomes**: 
- Identified fundamental mismatch between generic visual testing protocol and infrastructure task nature
- Corrected testing approach from 5-phase visual testing to 4-phase infrastructure testing
- Documented that T-1.2.1 has no visual components and requires configuration validation instead
- Updated testing strategy to focus on TypeScript compilation, ESLint enforcement, and path alias functionality
- Received explicit user directive to skip Phase 3 and Phase 4 execution in testing protocol

**Relevant Learnings**: 
- Generic testing protocols may not suit all task types - infrastructure tasks require different validation approaches
- Visual testing is inappropriate for configuration files and compiler settings
- Testing approach must match task nature: T-1.2.1 requires functional validation through compilation and rule enforcement
- Critical to analyze task elements before applying testing methodologies

**Technical Context**: 
- T-1.2.1 implementation completed with enhanced TypeScript strict mode (6 additional options), comprehensive path aliases (9 patterns), and ESLint TypeScript rules (20+ rules)
- Configuration validated to work with Next.js 15.3.3 and detect 59 type safety issues in existing codebase
- Testing environment must validate configuration effectiveness through compiler behavior rather than visual rendering
- All configuration files properly formatted and functioning per implementation validation

**Critical Testing Requirements Gap Analysis**: 
- Original testing protocol assumed all tasks have renderable React components
- T-1.2.1 elements are configuration files requiring infrastructure testing approaches
- Testing must focus on: configuration file validation, TypeScript compilation with strict mode, ESLint rule enforcement, path alias resolution, build process compatibility
- Visual testing phases (Phase 3 & 4) explicitly marked as "Do not execute" for this infrastructure task

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```
