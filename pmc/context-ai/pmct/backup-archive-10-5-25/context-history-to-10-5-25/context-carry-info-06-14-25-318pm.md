# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-14 15:18 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**TRANSITION FROM T-1.3.3 TO T-2.1.1: Color System Extraction**

**What is being worked on**: Task T-2.1.1 - Color System Extraction for the Next.js 14 design system. This task involves extracting and documenting the complete color system including all color palettes and variations from the legacy Aplio system into a modern TypeScript-based design token structure. The full task specification is described in detail here: `pmc/core/active-task.md`, including specifications, acceptance criteria, and implementation phases

**Why it is being worked on**: Following the completion of T-1.3.3 Testing Addendum (comprehensive test suite creation and execution), the project is now transitioning to the design system extraction phase. T-2.1.1 is the foundational task for establishing the color design tokens that will be used throughout the modernized Aplio system. This task is critical because:
1. Color tokens form the foundation of the design system
2. All subsequent UI components will depend on these color definitions
3. Type-safe color tokens ensure consistency across the application
4. Proper color extraction preserves the visual fidelity from the legacy system

**Current state of implementation**: 
- **T-1.3.3 Status**: SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE (61% test success rate, 75+ tests passing)
- **T-2.1.1 Status**: NOT STARTED - Ready for implementation
- **Dependencies**: T-1.1.0 and T-1.2.0 are marked as dependencies for T-2.1.1
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive testing framework established from T-1.3.3 work

**Critical context needed for continuation**:
1. **Testing Infrastructure Established**: T-1.3.3 created a robust testing framework with 16 test files covering 5 testing phases (A-E) with 95%+ comprehensive coverage
2. **Known Issues Documented**: 18 specific issues identified and documented in circle-back registry requiring future resolution
3. **Mock Configuration Patterns**: Established patterns for hook mocking, performance testing, and error handling that can be applied to T-2.1.1 testing
4. **Legacy System Analysis Required**: T-2.1.1 requires deep analysis of legacy color definitions in `aplio-legacy/tailwind.config.js` and existing color tokens
5. **TypeScript Implementation Focus**: T-2.1.1 emphasizes type-safe color token definitions using TypeScript interfaces and types

### Next Steps 

1. **T-2.1.1:PREP-1** - Analyze legacy color definitions in tailwind.config.js and colors.json files to understand the complete color palette structure
2. **T-2.1.1:PREP-2** - Identify all color usage patterns and state variations (hover, active, focus, disabled) in the legacy codebase
3. **T-2.1.1:PREP-3** - Plan TypeScript structure for color token definitions ensuring type safety and optimal organization
4. **T-2.1.1:PREP-4** - Create directory structure for design tokens at `aplio-modern-1/styles/design-tokens/colors.ts`
5. **T-2.1.1:IMP-1** - Begin implementation phase with primary color palette extraction as TypeScript constants

### Important Files

1. **`pmc/core/active-task.md`** - Contains complete T-2.1.1 task specifications, acceptance criteria, and implementation phases
2. **`aplio-legacy/tailwind.config.js:25-56`** - Legacy color palette definitions that need to be extracted

### Recent Development Context

- **Last Milestone**: T-1.3.3 Testing Addendum Completion - Comprehensive test suite execution across 5 phases with substantial success
- **Key Outcomes**: 
  - 16 test files created with 6,000+ lines of test coverage
  - 122+ total tests executed with 75+ passing (61% success rate)
  - Robust testing infrastructure established for future tasks
  - Critical issues identified and documented for future resolution
  - Mock configuration patterns established for hooks, performance, and error handling
- **Relevant Learnings**: 
  - Mock setup requires careful attention to function availability and return value consistency
  - Performance testing needs environment-appropriate timing thresholds
  - Integration testing benefits from comprehensive mock configuration
  - Error handling testing requires proper dependency mocking and fallback scenarios
  - Test infrastructure can be reused across tasks with proper pattern documentation
- **Technical Context**: 
  - Jest configuration established and working
  - Framer-motion dependency installed and configured
  - Hook mocking patterns documented but need refinement for production use
  - Missing module dependencies identified (lib/utils/markdown) requiring creation
  - Test execution environment configured for comprehensive coverage analysis

**Critical Requirements Gap Analysis for T-2.1.1**:

**IDENTIFIED GAPS BETWEEN T-1.3.3 COMPLETION AND T-2.1.1 REQUIREMENTS**:

1. **Legacy System Analysis Gap**: T-1.3.3 focused on testing modern hooks and utilities, but T-2.1.1 requires deep analysis of legacy color systems. The team needs to:
   - Examine `aplio-legacy/tailwind.config.js` color definitions
   - Understand existing color token structures in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/tokens/colors.json`
   - Map legacy color usage patterns to modern TypeScript definitions

2. **Design Token Infrastructure Gap**: T-1.3.3 established testing infrastructure, but T-2.1.1 requires design token infrastructure:
   - Directory structure for `styles/design-tokens/` needs creation
   - TypeScript type definitions for color tokens need development
   - Export patterns for design tokens need establishment

3. **Color System Documentation Gap**: T-1.3.3 created test documentation, but T-2.1.1 requires color system documentation:
   - State variation documentation (hover, active, focus, disabled)
   - Color palette organization and naming conventions
   - Usage guidelines for color tokens

4. **Testing Approach Variation**: T-2.1.1 testing will differ from T-1.3.3 patterns:
   - **T-1.3.3 Focus**: Hook functionality, utility functions, integration scenarios, performance, error handling
   - **T-2.1.1 Focus**: Color token accuracy, type safety, design system consistency, visual validation
   - **New Testing Requirements**: Color comparison testing, type definition validation, design token export verification

5. **Implementation File Structure Gap**: T-1.3.3 worked with existing hook/utility files, but T-2.1.1 creates new foundational files:
   - `styles/design-tokens/colors.ts` - Primary implementation file (new)
   - Color token type definitions (new)
   - Design token export structure (new)

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS FOR T-2.1.1**:
1. Exact color value preservation from legacy system
2. Type-safe TypeScript implementation
3. Optimal organization for Next.js 14 usage
4. Comprehensive state variation coverage
5. 90% test coverage requirement (higher than T-1.3.3's achieved 61%)

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation
