# Context Carry-Over: T-3.3.3 Mobile Navigation Enhanced Phase B Testing
**Date:** 2025-01-14 11:48 PM
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization - T-3.3.3 Mobile Navigation
**Context Version:** B.1

## Primary Instruction Source

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: Your primary instruction document is:
**`pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced-phase-B-conductor-only.md`**

This document contains the complete step-by-step execution protocol for Enhanced Phase B Testing. Read it thoroughly before proceeding.

## Project Brief

T-3.3.3 Mobile Navigation components are fully implemented but traditional unit testing showed 28% success rate due to DOM API limitations in Jest/jsdom environment. Enhanced Phase B Testing uses a multi-modal approach (scaffolds + screenshots + AI analysis) to overcome these limitations and validate the components through visual evidence.

## Current Progress Status

### Where You Are in the Process
According to `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced-phase-B-conductor-only.md`:

**‚úÖ Step 1: Context Preparation** - COMPLETED
- Implementation status reviewed
- Task requirements analyzed

**üîÑ Step 2: Execute Enhanced Phase B Testing** - IN PROGRESS
- **‚úÖ Phase B1**: Create 16 targeted scaffolds - COMPLETED
- **‚úÖ Phase B2**: Capture visual screenshots - COMPLETED  
- **üöÄ Phase B3**: Execute Enhanced LLM Vision analysis - READY TO START ‚Üê **YOU ARE HERE**
- **‚è≥ Phase B4**: Generate comprehensive validation reports - PENDING

**‚è≥ Step 3: Final Validation and Reporting** - PENDING

### What's Been Completed
- 16 scaffolds created in `aplio-modern-1/test/scaffolds/T-3.3.3/`
- 16 screenshots captured in `aplio-modern-1/test/screenshots/T-3.3.3/`
- Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer script ready at `aplio-modern-1/test/utils/vision/enhanced-llm-vision-analyzer.js`

### What You Need to Do
**Execute Phase B3** as defined in the conductor document:
1. Use the existing script at `aplio-modern-1/test/utils/vision/enhanced-llm-vision-analyzer.js`
2. Analyze all 16 screenshots in `aplio-modern-1/test/screenshots/T-3.3.3/` with ‚â•95% confidence requirement
3. Sleep 60 seconds between API calls for rate limiting
4. Generate comprehensive vision analysis reports
5. Move to Phase B4 for final reporting

**Legacy Reference**: `aplio-legacy/components/navbar/PrimaryNavbar.jsx`

## Important Notes

- **DO NOT** create new scripts - use the existing Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer
- **DO** follow the conductor document's step-by-step protocol
- **DO** ensure 60-second sleep between API calls
- **DO** validate ‚â•95% confidence scores for all analyses
- Navigate to `aplio-modern-1/` directory for all operations

## Next Action
Read `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced-phase-B-conductor-only.md` and execute Phase B3 as instructed.
