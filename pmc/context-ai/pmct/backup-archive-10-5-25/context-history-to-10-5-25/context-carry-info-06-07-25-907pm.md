# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-07 21:07 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]
**Task Transition: T-1.2.2 Testing Complete â†’ T-1.2.3 Implementation Ready**

**What is being worked on:** 
T-1.2.2 Component Type Definitions has been successfully tested and validated through comprehensive automated testing. The next agent will begin implementation of T-1.2.3 API and Utility Type Definitions.

**Why it is being worked on:**
T-1.2.3 is the next sequential task in the TypeScript modernization track (T-1.2.x series), building upon the foundation established by T-1.2.2. It creates API type interfaces and utility function types necessary for type-safe data handling and utility operations throughout the application.

**Current state of implementation:**
- T-1.2.2: âœ… COMPLETED - All component type definitions tested and validated
- T-1.2.3: ðŸŸ¡ READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION - Task initialized, requirements reviewed, ready for coding

**Critical context needed for continuation:**
1. **T-1.2.2 Success Foundation**: All component prop types and state types are now validated and working. The next agent has a solid TypeScript foundation to build upon.

2. **Testing Infrastructure**: Complete Jest testing environment is established at `test/unit-tests/task-1-2.2/T-1.2.2/` with TypeScript support, which can be extended for T-1.2.3 testing.

3. **Type Definition Patterns**: Established patterns in `types/components/` directory show successful approach for organizing type definitions - same patterns should be applied to API and utility types.

4. **Integration Validation**: T-1.2.2 types successfully integrate with existing components (Button, Card, FaqItem), proving the type system architecture is sound.

5. **Requirements Gap Analysis**: T-1.2.3 requires examination of legacy API structures (`aplio-legacy/data/api.js:1-30`) and utility functions (`aplio-legacy/utils/helpers.js:1-50`) to create equivalent TypeScript definitions.

### Current Active Action 
**Task:** T-1.2.3 - API and Utility Type Definitions  
**Phase:** Preparation (Ready to Begin)  
**Active Element:** None - Task initialization complete  
**Last Recorded Action:** Task updated to T-1.2.3 by human operator, ready for next agent implementation

### Next Steps 
1. **PREP-1**: Identify API endpoints and data structures from legacy references (Priority: High, Dependencies: None)
2. **PREP-2**: Catalog utility functions requiring type definitions from legacy code (Priority: High, Dependencies: None)  
3. **IMP-1-4**: Implementation phase covering API request/response types and utility function types (Priority: Medium, Dependencies: PREP completion)
4. **VAL-1-2**: Validation testing for API calls and utility functions (Priority: Medium, Dependencies: IMP completion)
5. **Testing Integration**: Extend existing Jest infrastructure for T-1.2.3 validation (Priority: Medium, Dependencies: Implementation phase)

### Recent Development Context

**Last Milestone**: T-1.2.2 Component Type Definitions - Comprehensive Automated Testing Completed Successfully

**Key Outcomes**: 
- âœ… All component prop types validated (BaseComponentProps, ButtonProps, CardProps, FaqItemProps)
- âœ… All state management types validated (ToggleState, LoadingState, FormFieldState<T>)
- âœ… Jest testing infrastructure established with TypeScript support
- âœ… TypeScript compilation validation passing for all type definitions
- âœ… Integration testing confirmed with existing components
- âœ… Test coverage tracking implemented and functional

**Relevant Learnings**:
1. **Type-Only Testing Approach**: Successfully validated TypeScript type definitions through compilation testing rather than runtime testing - 0% statement coverage is expected and correct for type-only files
2. **Testing Infrastructure Patterns**: Jest + ts-jest + TypeScript configuration pattern works effectively for type validation
3. **Legacy Integration Strategy**: TypeScript types can successfully replace JavaScript patterns while maintaining compatibility
4. **Testing Phases Adaptation**: Phases 3-4 (Visual Testing, LLM Vision Analysis) were appropriately skipped for infrastructure tasks focused on type definitions rather than UI components

**Technical Context**:
- Testing environment established at `test/unit-tests/task-1-2.2/T-1.2.2/`
- Jest configuration with ts-jest preset and proper module resolution
- TypeScript configuration with path aliases (`@/types/*`) working correctly
- All testing dependencies installed (Jest 29.7.0, TypeScript, ts-jest, @types/jest)

**Testing Approach Variations Made**:
1. **Scope Adaptation**: Focused on TypeScript type definitions rather than visual components, appropriately skipping visual testing phases
2. **Coverage Interpretation**: Correctly interpreted 0% statement coverage as expected for type-only files
3. **Validation Strategy**: Used TypeScript compilation (`npx tsc --noEmit`) as primary validation method instead of runtime testing
4. **Integration Focus**: Emphasized compatibility with existing components (Button, Card, FaqItem) to ensure smooth TypeScript migration

**Implementation Requirements Gap Analysis for T-1.2.3**:
Based on T-1.2.2 completion and T-1.2.3 requirements, the following gaps need attention:

1. **Legacy Code Analysis Required**: T-1.2.3 depends on examining `aplio-legacy/data/api.js:1-30` and `aplio-legacy/utils/helpers.js:1-50` to understand existing patterns
2. **API Type Structure**: Need to create TypeScript interfaces for request/response patterns used in legacy JavaScript API calls
3. **Utility Function Types**: Need to add proper parameter and return type definitions to utility functions
4. **Testing Extension**: Existing Jest infrastructure needs extension for API mock testing (MSW - Mock Service Worker mentioned in requirements)
5. **Type Organization**: Need to establish `types/api/` and `types/utils/` directories following patterns from `types/components/`

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```
