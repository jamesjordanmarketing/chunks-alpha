## Analysis and Specifications Prompt for Functional Requirements and Wireframe Generation Workflow

### Question 1: User Journey Integration with Functional Requirements Generation

**Current State Analysis:**
The project currently has a detailed user journey document (`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\brun8\pmc\product\03.5-bmo-user-journey.md`) with comprehensive persona definitions, stage-by-stage workflows, and success criteria. The functional requirements generation process uses three sequential prompts:
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\brun8\pmc\product\_prompt_engineering\3a-preprocess-functional-requirements-prompt_v1.md` (organization and cleanup)
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\brun8\pmc\product\_prompt_engineering\3b-#1-functional-requirements-prompt_v1.md` (enhancement part 1)
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\brun8\pmc\product\_prompt_engineering\3b-functional-requirements-prompt_v1.md` (enhancement part 2)

**Integration Assessment Required:**
Determine if the user journey document should be integrated as input for all three functional requirements prompts to improve:
1. **User-Centric Requirements**: Ensure FRs directly address user pain points and success criteria
2. **Persona-Specific Acceptance Criteria**: Tailor requirements to specific user personas (Small Business Owner, Domain Expert, etc.)
2. **Persona Acceptance Criteria Consolidation**: It is not practical to createe a new wireframe or even segment one wireframe into multiple user journeys. Yes the acceptance criteria for each persona are important, but a wireframe or functional requirement expressed as "per pesona" is not reasonable or useful. So the solution devised needs to consolidate the acceptance criteria into one non persona specific specification.
3. **Journey Stage Alignment**: Map functional requirements to specific user journey stages
4. **Success Metrics Integration**: Include user journey success definitions in FR acceptance criteria

**Specification for Investigation:**
- **Input Analysis**: Review current FR generation prompts to identify gaps in user-centric perspective
- **Journey Mapping**: Analyze how user journey stages (discovery, upload, exploration, generation, quality control, expansion) could inform FR structure
- **Persona Integration**: Evaluate if persona-specific requirements would improve wireframe generation quality
- **Success Criteria Alignment**: Assess if user journey success metrics should be embedded in FR acceptance criteria

**Recommended Investigation Approach:**
1. Compare current FRs against user journey requirements
2. Identify gaps where user journey insights could strengthen FRs
3. Test integration with one FR generation prompt as proof-of-concept
4. Measure improvement in wireframe generation quality and user-centricity

### Question 2: Wireframe Generation Workflow Optimization Analysis

**Current Workflow Assessment:**
The existing wireframe generation follows this pattern:
1. Template: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\brun8\pmc\product\_prompt_engineering\04-FR-wireframes-prompt_v4.md` (generator prompt)
2. Stage-specific prompt: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\brun8\pmc\product\_prompt_engineering\04-FR-wireframes-prompt-E01.md` (parameterized)
3. FIGMA output: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\brun8\pmc\product\_prompt_engineering\04-bmo-FR-wireframes-output-E01.md` (final prompt)
4. Input dependency: Stage-specific FR file `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\brun8\pmc\product\04-bmo-FR-wireframes-E01.md`

**Critical Workflow Questions to Address:**

**A. User Journey vs User Stories Input Stack:**
- **Current**: Uses user stories as primary input for wireframe generation
- **Potential**: Replace user stories with user journey document as primary input
- **Investigation Required**: 
  - Does user journey provide more actionable UI/UX guidance than user stories?
  - Would persona-specific wireframes improve user experience?
  - Can journey stage workflows translate directly to wireframe flows?

**B. Functional Requirements Dependency Analysis:**
- **Current**: Stage-specific FR files drive wireframe acceptance criteria
- **Question**: Is this the optimal approach or should wireframes be generated from:
  - User journey workflows directly?
  - Combined user journey + simplified FRs?
  - Persona-specific journey maps?

**C. Input Stack Optimization Options:**

**Option 1: Enhanced Current Approach**
- Keep FR-driven wireframes
- Integrate user journey insights into FR generation
- Maintain current workflow with improved inputs

**Option 2: Journey-First Approach**
- Generate wireframes directly from user journey stages
- Use FRs as validation/enhancement layer
- Prioritize user flow over technical requirements

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach**
- Create persona-specific wireframe variants
- Use journey stages for flow definition
- Use FRs for technical constraint validation

**Specification for Workflow Analysis:**

**Phase 1: Current State Evaluation**
- Analyze quality of existing wireframes generated from FR-driven approach
- Identify gaps in user experience focus
- Document technical vs user-centric requirement balance

**Phase 2: Alternative Input Testing**
- Test wireframe generation using user journey as primary input
- Compare output quality, user-centricity, and technical completeness
- Evaluate persona-specific wireframe variations

**Phase 3: Optimization Recommendation**
- Define optimal input stack for FIGMA wireframe prompts
- Specify integration points between user journey, user stories, and FRs
- Create enhanced workflow that maximizes both user experience and technical accuracy

**Success Criteria for Workflow Optimization:**
1. **User Experience Quality**: Wireframes reflect actual user workflows and pain points
2. **Technical Completeness**: All functional requirements are addressed in UI design
3. **Persona Alignment**: Wireframes serve specific user personas effectively
4. **Development Efficiency**: Wireframes provide clear implementation guidance
5. **Stakeholder Clarity**: Non-technical users can validate wireframes against their needs

**Next Steps for Implementation:**
1. **Document Current Workflow Performance**: Measure existing wireframe quality and gaps
2. **Test User Journey Integration**: Run pilot wireframe generation with journey-first approach
3. **Compare Approaches**: Quantitative and qualitative analysis of different input stacks
4. **Define Optimal Workflow**: Create enhanced wireframe generation process
5. **Update Templates**: Modify prompt templates based on optimization findings

**Key Questions for Resolution:**
- Should user journey replace user stories as wireframe input?
- How can persona-specific needs be better reflected in wireframes?
- What is the optimal balance between user experience and technical requirements?
- Can the workflow be simplified while improving output quality?
- How should functional requirements be restructured to better support wireframe generation?
