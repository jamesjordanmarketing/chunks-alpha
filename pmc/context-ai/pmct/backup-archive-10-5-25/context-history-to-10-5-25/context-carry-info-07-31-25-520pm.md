# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-07-31 17:20 PST
**Project:** Bright Run & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **LoRA Fine-Tuning Training Data Platform**: Bright Run is a comprehensive LoRA fine-tuning training data platform that transforms an organization's raw, unstructured knowledge into proprietary LoRA-ready training datasets through an intuitive six-stage workflow. The platform enables non-technical users to create custom LLMs that think with their unique knowledge, beliefs, and proprietary processes while maintaining complete data ownership and privacy.

This context document focuses on creating a comprehensive, authoritative guide for AI coding agents on how to use the Pipeline State Management System (T-1.1.1). The current documentation exists in multiple versions with varying levels of detail and structure, requiring consolidation into a definitive v2 specification.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Bright Runproject. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Bright Run benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus
Your task is to do what I am requesting below:

We had been updating this specification pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01.md by following these instructions: pmc\system\plans\context-carries\context-history\context-carry-info-07-31-25-418pm.md

It updated this file correctly: 

But the problem is that it tried to do the next step which was: 
`combine pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01.md with pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01b.md

So that:
`
1. The full spec has all of the tasks from both files

2. The new Content Analysis spec in pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01b.md

upgrades the Content Analysis spec in pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01.md

3. Make sure to remove any duplicate steps or instructions

4. Make sure to number everything correctly in build sequence

5. Put the updated spec in pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01c.md"`

THe problem is that it tried that last update twice and both times it said "Output is too long, please enter 'Continue' to get more."

So now we need to:
Take both of the attempted updated specs which are here:
pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01c-1.md
and here
pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01c-2.md

1. Evaluate both these incompleted output files:
pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01c-1.md
and
pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01c-2.md

2. Evaluate theme, combine them, keep everything needed from both of them and remove any duplicate steps, actions, or knowlege. 

3. Read the original: pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01.md instructions to make sure nothing is left out.
- Finish the final version which you will put here:
pmc\product\_mapping\task-file-maps\6-bmo-tasks-new-E01d.md
