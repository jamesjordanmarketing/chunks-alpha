# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-15 12:06 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**Current Focus**: **T-2.1.4: Animation and Transition System Extraction** - Design Token Implementation  

**What is being worked on**: The next task in the design token extraction sequence (T-2.1.4) following the successful completion and comprehensive testing validation of T-2.1.3: Spacing and Layout System Extraction. This task focuses on extracting animation timing values, easing functions, and transition durations from the legacy Aplio codebase into TypeScript design tokens.

**Why it is being worked on**: This is part of the systematic modernization of the Aplio Design System following the P006-DESIGN-TOKENS pattern. T-2.1.4 continues the design token extraction sequence that began with T-2.1.2 (Typography) and T-2.1.3 (Spacing), building a comprehensive type-safe design system foundation for Next.js 14.

**Current state of implementation**: 
- **T-2.1.3 Status**: âœ… **FULLY COMPLETE** with comprehensive testing validation
- **T-2.1.4 Status**: ðŸ†• **READY TO START** - Not yet initiated, waiting for development agent

**Implementation Location**: `aplio-modern-1\styles\design-tokens\animations.ts`
**Pattern**: P006-DESIGN-TOKENS
**Testing Protocol**: Adapted design token validation (not component testing)

**Critical Context for Continuation**:
1. **Testing Protocol Adaptation**: Use the adapted testing approach developed for T-2.1.3 that focuses on TypeScript compilation, token accuracy, and utility function validation rather than visual component testing
2. **Legacy Fidelity Requirement**: Maintain 100% exact value preservation from legacy sources
3. **TypeScript Pattern**: Follow the successful pattern established in T-2.1.2 (typography.ts) and T-2.1.3 (spacing.ts) for interface definitions, 'as const' assertions, and utility functions
4. **Testing Infrastructure**: Use Jest unit testing with dynamic imports for design token validation as proven successful in T-2.1.3

Do not deviate from this focus without explicit instruction.

  - **Spacing Token Pattern**: Complete TypeScript interfaces with 'as const' assertions and utility functions established in `spacing.ts`

**Critical Testing Context for T-2.1.4**: Use the exact same adapted testing approach developed for T-2.1.3 - do NOT attempt to use visual component testing protocols for animation design tokens.

### T-2.1.3 Testing Session Comprehensive Summary

**Complete Execution Overview**: This session successfully executed the role of AI Testing Agent Conductor for T-2.1.3: Spacing and Layout System Extraction, developing and validating a comprehensive testing protocol specifically adapted for design token validation.

**Key Accomplishments**:
1. **Discovered Critical Insight**: T-2.1.3 is design tokens (TypeScript), not React components - required complete testing protocol adaptation
2. **Successfully Adapted Testing Protocol**: Modified standard component testing to focus on TypeScript compilation, token accuracy, and utility function validation
3. **Achieved 100% Test Success**: All 7 test cases passed validating 4 T-2.1.3 elements (ELE-1 through ELE-4)
4. **Established Testing Infrastructure**: Created working Jest pattern with dynamic imports for design token validation
5. **Validated Legacy Fidelity**: Confirmed exact preservation of critical custom spacing values (60px, 100px, 150px)

**Generated Testing Artifacts**:
- `pmc\system\plans\task-approach\current-test-discovery.md` - Complete testable elements analysis
- `test\unit-tests\task-2-1.3\T-2.1.3\spacing-basic.test.ts` - Working test suite (7/7 tests passed)
- `test\reports\T-2.1.3-testing-report.md` - Comprehensive testing validation report

**Protocol Adaptations Made**:
- **Skipped Phase 3 (Visual Testing)**: Not applicable for design tokens
- **Skipped Phase 4 (LLM Vision Analysis)**: Not applicable for design tokens  
- **Modified Phase 2 (Unit Testing)**: Focus on TypeScript compilation and value accuracy rather than component rendering
- **Enhanced Phase 1 (Discovery)**: Created design token classification system vs React component classification

**T-2.1.4 Requirements Gap Analysis**:
After reviewing T-2.1.4 task requirements, the testing approach developed for T-2.1.3 maps perfectly:
- **ELE-1 (Animation timing)**: Same pattern as spacing values - TypeScript constants with 'as const'
- **ELE-2 (Easing functions)**: Same pattern as component spacing patterns - interface definitions
- **ELE-3 (Transition durations)**: Same pattern as layout spacing utilities - structured token mapping
- **ELE-4 (Animation token types)**: Same pattern as spacing utility functions - TypeScript interfaces and utility functions

**No Testing Gaps Identified**: The adapted testing protocol from T-2.1.3 is fully applicable to T-2.1.4 animation design tokens.

**Critical Testing Variations for Next Agent**:
1. **Dynamic Import Pattern**: Must use `await import('../../../../styles/design-tokens/animations')` in tests
2. **Jest beforeAll Setup**: Required to avoid TypeScript compilation issues at test runtime
3. **Value Accuracy Focus**: Animation timings and easing functions must match legacy sources exactly
4. **No Visual Testing**: Do not attempt component scaffolding or screenshot testing for animation tokens

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)
