# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-10 21:37 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 4.2.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**Primary Task**: Implementation of Start-Task Command Archiving System Enhancement

**What is being worked on**:
Comprehensive modification of the `start-task` command in `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` to replace the current concatenated history file system with individual timestamped archive files. This critical infrastructure improvement will enhance PMC's task history organization and maintainability. The detailed specifications for this change is contained in: pmc/context-ai/chat-contexts-log/pmct/update-start-task-separate-files.md

**Why it is being worked on**:
1. The current system appends all task history to two large concatenated files (`active-task-history.md` at 1.3MB and `active-task-unit-tests-history.md` at 2.3MB), making task history difficult to navigate and manage
2. Individual archived files will enable better organization, easier retrieval of specific task contexts, and improved system maintainability
3. This change aligns with the existing pattern established in `test-approach-and-discovery.js` for consistent timestamping and archiving across PMC

**Current state of implementation**:
- **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive analysis of current `context-manager-v2.js` implementation
- **COMPLETED**: Detailed examination of reference implementation in `test-approach-and-discovery.js`
- **COMPLETED**: Full technical specification created with step-by-step implementation plan
- **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**: All code examples, safety checks, and implementation guidance prepared

**Critical context needed for continuation**:
- The start-task command is absolutely critical to PMC operations and cannot be broken
- Current implementation uses `startTaskV2Enhanced` function (called from CLI)
- Two history appending calls need to be replaced with archiving logic (lines 3470 & 3486)
- The `appendToHistoryFile` function must be removed entirely (lines 1850-1875)
- Archive files must use exact timestamp format from `test-approach-and-discovery.js`: `MM-DD-YY-HHmmAM/PM`
- Implementation must handle both V1 and V2 test files gracefully

**Implementation Status**: T-1.3.1 is 94% complete (31 of 33 component states certified), with 2 minor component issues identified but deferred. T-1.3.2 is ready to begin but prioritized after start-task updates. Do not start coding T-1.3.2 until the human operator instructs you to.

Do not deviate from this focus without explicit instruction.

### Next Steps

1. **Implement Start-Task Archiving System**
   - File: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js`
   - Description: Execute the 8-step implementation plan from specification document which is here pmc/context-ai/chat-contexts-log/pmct/update-start-task-separate-files.md
   - Dependencies: Complete backup of existing file, thorough testing of each step
   - Expected outcome: Start-task command archives previous files individually instead of concatenating to history files

2. **Test Start-Task Functionality**
   - Action: Run comprehensive validation of modified start-task command
   - Description: Execute test scenarios to ensure all functionality preserved while archiving works correctly
   - Dependencies: Step 1 completion
   - Expected outcome: Verified working start-task with proper archive file creation

3. **Validate Archive File Structure**
   - Action: Verify archive files use correct naming and contain proper content
   - Description: Ensure timestamped files follow expected format: `active-task-T-X.X.X-MM-DD-YY-HHmmAM.md`
   - Dependencies: Steps 1-2 completion
   - Expected outcome: Properly organized task history in individual timestamped files

4. **Resume T-1.3.2 Implementation** 
   - Task: T-1.3.2: Server/Client Component Pattern Implementation
   - Description: Begin work on server/client component patterns after PMC infrastructure improvements
   - Dependencies: Start-task updates fully tested and validated
   - Expected outcome: Active task ready for T-1.3.2 development work

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
```bash
node system/management/carryover-command.js
```
