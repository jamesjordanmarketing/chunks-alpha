# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-07 11:00 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.1.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 15's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]

**PRIMARY FOCUS**: Unit Testing for Task T-1.2.1: TypeScript Configuration Setup

The immediate focus is conducting comprehensive unit testing for the recently completed TypeScript configuration setup task. This testing phase will validate that the enhanced TypeScript configuration, ESLint rules, and development environment settings are working correctly and meet all acceptance criteria.

**CONTEXT**: Task T-1.2.1 has been fully implemented with all phases complete (PREP, IMP, VAL). The implementation has been validated for basic functionality, but comprehensive unit testing is required to ensure:

1. **Enhanced Strict Mode Configuration**: All additional TypeScript strict mode options are properly enforced
2. **Path Aliases Functionality**: All configured path aliases resolve correctly in different scenarios  
3. **ESLint Integration**: TypeScript-specific rules are properly enforcing code quality
4. **Development Environment**: VSCode settings and extensions provide optimal TypeScript development experience
5. **Configuration Compatibility**: All configurations work seamlessly with Next.js 15 and the existing project structure

**IMPLEMENTATION STATE**: All code has been implemented and basic validation completed. The configuration has been tested manually and found to be working correctly, with the enhanced strict mode properly detecting 59 type safety issues in the existing codebase (demonstrating the configuration is functioning as intended).

**CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR TESTING**:
- Enhanced TypeScript configuration includes 6 additional strict mode options beyond basic `strict: true`
- Comprehensive path aliases configured for 9 different directory patterns
- ESLint enhanced with 20+ TypeScript-specific rules for code quality and type safety
- VSCode workspace optimized with TypeScript-specific settings and recommended extensions
- All configurations are compatible with Next.js 15.3.3 and maintain existing project structure

### Current Active Action 

**Task ID**: T-1.2.1
**Task Title**: TypeScript Configuration Setup
**Current Phase**: Testing Phase (Post-Implementation)
**Active Focus**: Comprehensive Unit Testing
**Last Recorded Action**: Task implementation completed successfully with all acceptance criteria met. All phases (PREP, IMP, VAL) marked as complete.
**Testing Requirements**: 
- Test Location: `aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-1-2/T-1.2.1/`
- Testing Tools: Jest, TypeScript Compiler API, ESLint, ts-node
- Test Coverage Requirement: 90% code coverage
- Elements to Test: 2 primary elements (T-1.2.1:ELE-1, T-1.2.1:ELE-2)

### Requirements Gap Analysis for Testing

**CRITICAL TESTING GAPS IDENTIFIED**:

1. **TypeScript Configuration Validation**: The implementation successfully configured enhanced TypeScript settings, but comprehensive testing is needed to verify:
   - All 6 additional strict mode options are properly enforcing their rules
   - Path aliases resolve correctly across different import scenarios
   - Configuration works with both development and build processes

2. **ESLint Integration Testing**: While ESLint runs without errors, testing is needed to verify:
   - TypeScript-specific rules are properly catching type safety issues
   - Rule configurations don't conflict with existing Next.js rules
   - Auto-fixing capabilities work correctly

3. **Development Environment Validation**: VSCode settings were created but need testing to verify:
   - IntelliSense improvements are functioning
   - Auto-import suggestions work with configured path aliases
   - Formatting and linting integration operates correctly

4. **Configuration Compatibility**: Testing required to ensure:
   - All configurations work seamlessly together
   - No performance degradation in development or build processes
   - Compatibility maintained with Next.js 15.3.3 (note: originally specified Next.js 14)

### Next Steps 

1. **Execute Enhanced Testing Protocol**: Follow the comprehensive testing protocol outlined in `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2.md` starting with Phase 0 environment setup
   - Dependencies: Testing infrastructure in place
   - Expected Outcome: Complete testing environment ready for T-1.2.1 validation

2. **Component Discovery & Classification**: Identify and classify all testable elements created by T-1.2.1 implementation using the discovery process
   - Dependencies: Task implementation completed (âœ… Done)
   - Expected Outcome: Comprehensive list of testable elements documented in `current-test-discovery.md`

3. **Generate Enhanced Scaffolds**: Create React SSR scaffolds for comprehensive testing of TypeScript configuration behavior
   - Dependencies: Component discovery completed
   - Expected Outcome: Test scaffolds created in `test/scaffolds/T-1.2.1/` directory

4. **Unit Testing Execution**: Run Jest unit tests with TypeScript integration to validate configuration effectiveness
   - Dependencies: Scaffolds and test structure in place
   - Expected Outcome: 90% test coverage achieved with all configuration aspects validated

5. **Visual Testing & Analysis**: Execute Playwright-based visual testing to ensure development environment improvements are working correctly
   - Dependencies: Unit tests passing
   - Expected Outcome: Visual confirmation of TypeScript configuration benefits and developer experience improvements

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
