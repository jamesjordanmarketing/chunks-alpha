# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-11 22:25 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]
**Task T-1.3.2: Server/Client Component Pattern Implementation - COMPLETED & READY FOR TESTING**

Task T-1.3.2 has been successfully completed through all three phases (Preparation, Implementation, and Validation). The implementation created a comprehensive server/client component pattern system for Next.js 14 App Router architecture. The task is now ready for comprehensive unit testing to validate the implementation meets all acceptance criteria.

**Implementation Scope Completed:**
1. **Server Component Template System**: Created `ServerComponentTemplate.tsx` with async data fetching capabilities, proper TypeScript interfaces, and server-first rendering patterns
2. **Client Component Template System**: Created `ClientComponentTemplate.tsx` with React hooks, event handlers, state management, and browser API integration
3. **Composition Pattern Library**: Implemented `CompositionPatterns.tsx` with 5 comprehensive patterns for server/client boundaries including conditional rendering, data fetching boundaries, slot patterns, and progressive enhancement
4. **Documentation System**: Created complete `server-client-components.md` documentation explaining architecture, best practices, and component boundaries
5. **Component Classification**: Analyzed all 11 existing components and classified them for server vs client implementation

**Current State:** Implementation complete with confidence level 9/10. All acceptance criteria met:
- ✅ Server components implemented by default for non-interactive components
- ✅ Client components explicitly marked with 'use client' directive  
- ✅ Composition patterns optimize client/server boundaries
- ✅ Data fetching isolated to server components

**Testing Requirements:** The implementation requires comprehensive testing to validate:
- Server component rendering without client-side JavaScript
- Client component hydration and interactivity
- Composition pattern functionality across boundaries
- Data fetching isolation and boundary optimization
- Component classification accuracy for all 11 components

Do not deviate from this testing focus without explicit instruction.

### Current Active Action 
**TESTING PHASE FOR T-1.3.2**
- Task ID: T-1.3.2
- Current Phase: Post-Implementation Testing
- Testing Focus: Server/Client Component Pattern Validation
- Test Location: `aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-1-3/T-1.3.2/`
- Last Action: Implementation Phase completed with all templates and patterns created

### Next Steps 
1. **Component Discovery & Classification Testing** - Validate all 11 components are properly classified and implemented according to server/client patterns (Priority: High)

2. **Server Component Validation Testing** - Execute comprehensive server component tests using `server-component-validation.test.tsx` to ensure proper rendering and data fetching (Priority: High)

3. **Client Component Validation Testing** - Execute client component tests using `client-component-validation.test.tsx` to validate hydration, interactivity, and state management (Priority: High)

4. **Composition Pattern Testing** - Test all 5 composition patterns using `composition-patterns-validation.test.tsx` to ensure proper server/client boundaries (Priority: High)

5. **Integration Testing** - Validate complete server/client integration across all components and patterns (Priority: Medium)

### Recent Development Context

**Last Milestone**: T-1.3.2 Server/Client Component Pattern Implementation completed successfully through all phases

**Key Outcomes**: 
- Created comprehensive server component template with async data fetching capabilities
- Implemented client component template with full interactivity and state management
- Developed 5 composition patterns for optimal server/client boundaries
- Documented complete architecture and best practices
- Classified all 11 existing components for proper server/client implementation

**Relevant Learnings**: 
- Server components provide significant performance benefits through pre-rendering
- Client boundaries must be carefully designed to minimize JavaScript bundle size
- Composition patterns are critical for maintaining clean server/client separation
- TypeScript interfaces must accommodate both server and client component patterns

**Technical Context**: 
- All templates created in `aplio-modern-1/components/design-system/templates/` directory
- Server components use async functions for data fetching
- Client components properly marked with 'use client' directive
- Composition patterns handle conditional rendering and data flow boundaries
- Documentation provides clear examples and best practices for team implementation

This project aims to transform the existing JavaScript-based Aplio theme into a modern TypeScript-powered Next.js 14 platform. The project specifically focuses on migrating the Home 4 template (https://js-aplio-6.vercel.app/home-4) as the flagship demonstration while preserving Aplio's premium design aesthetics from the existing design system in `/aplio-legacy/`.

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
