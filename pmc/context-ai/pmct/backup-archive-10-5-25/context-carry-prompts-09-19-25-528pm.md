You are tasked with updating the context carryover file at:
system/context-carry-info-09-19-25-528pm.md

First, read the entire file to understand its current structure and content.

Then, update the "Current Focus" section with the following requirements:

1. **Active Development Focus**
   - Be explicit about the task
   - Include full paths where applicable

You are not going to execute the below. Your task is to update: system/context-carry-info-09-19-25-528pm.md with the details of what I am requesting below:

# Document Categorization System - Database Integration Status

## üìã Project Summary

This is a Next.js document categorization application that allows users to categorize documents through a multi-step workflow. The application has been successfully deployed to Vercel with working UI components, but currently operates in "demo mode" using mock data instead of real database operations.

### What Led to This Point

1. **Initial Deployment Issues**: The Vercel deployment was showing plain text without CSS/JavaScript
2. **CSS Configuration Fixed**: Added proper Tailwind CSS configuration (`tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`) and updated `src/app/globals.css`
3. **UI Now Working**: Application displays correctly with functional buttons, selections, and navigation
4. **Database Investigation**: Discovered that document choices are not being saved to Supabase database

### Current Application Status

‚úÖ **Working Components**:
- UI/UX fully functional with Tailwind CSS
- Document selection workflow (Steps A, B, C)
- Category and tag selection interfaces
- Navigation and state management
- Vercel deployment: https://categ-module.vercel.app/dashboard

‚ùå **Missing Database Integration**:
- No actual Supabase tables created
- API endpoints return mock responses
- Workflow data not persisted to database
- Using mock data throughout the application

## üîß Database Integration Issues to Fix

### Issue 1: Missing Database Schema

**Problem**: Required Supabase tables don't exist
- Tables needed: `documents`, `workflow_sessions`, `categories`, `tags`, `tag_dimensions`, `user_profiles`, `processing_jobs`
- Current error: "Could not find the table 'public.documents' in the schema cache"

**Solution**: 
- Run the provided `setup-database.sql` script in Supabase SQL Editor
- Script includes complete schema with relationships, indexes, RLS policies, and sample data
- File location: `setup-database.sql` (root directory)

### Issue 2: Mock API Responses

**Problem**: API endpoints return simulated success without database operations
- File: `src/app/api/workflow/route.ts`
- Current behavior: Returns mock `workflowId` and success messages
- No actual Supabase integration in POST handlers

**Solution**: Replace mock responses with real Supabase operations
```typescript
// Current (lines 50-92):
return NextResponse.json({ 
  success: true, 
  workflowId: `workflow-${Date.now()}` 
});

// Needs to become:
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('workflow_sessions')
  .insert(workflowData)
  .select()
  .single();
```

### Issue 3: Mock Store Operations

**Problem**: Workflow store simulates database operations
- File: `src/stores/workflow-store.ts`
- Function: `submitWorkflow` (lines 198-227)
- Current: 2-second delay simulation, no real API calls

**Solution**: Update to call real API endpoints
```typescript
// Replace simulation with:
const response = await fetch('/api/workflow', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ action: 'submit', ...workflowData })
});
```

### Issue 4: Database Service Layer

**Problem**: Database services use mock implementations
- File: `src/lib/database.ts`
- Current: Returns mock data from `src/data/supabase-mock.ts`

**Solution**: Implement real Supabase operations
- Replace mock functions with actual Supabase client calls
- Use proper error handling and data validation
- Maintain same interface for seamless integration

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Database Setup (Priority: HIGH)
1. Access Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run `setup-database.sql` script
4. Verify tables created successfully
5. Test with `node test-database.js` (comprehensive test script provided)

### Step 2: API Integration (Priority: HIGH)
1. Update `src/app/api/workflow/route.ts`:
   - Import Supabase client
   - Replace mock responses with real database operations
   - Handle `save_draft`, `submit`, and `validate` actions
   - Add proper error handling

### Step 3: Store Integration (Priority: MEDIUM)
1. Update `src/stores/workflow-store.ts`:
   - Replace `submitWorkflow` simulation with real API calls
   - Update `saveDraft` function
   - Add proper loading states and error handling

### Step 4: Database Service Layer (Priority: MEDIUM)
1. Update `src/lib/database.ts`:
   - Replace mock implementations with real Supabase operations
   - Maintain existing function signatures
   - Add proper TypeScript types

### Step 5: Testing & Verification (Priority: HIGH)
1. Run `node test-database.js` to verify database connectivity
2. Test complete workflow in browser
3. Verify data persistence in Supabase dashboard
4. Test error scenarios and edge cases

## üìÅ Key Files to Modify

| File Path | Purpose | Changes Needed |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| `setup-database.sql` | Database schema | ‚úÖ Ready to run |
| `test-database.js` | Verification script | ‚úÖ Ready to use |
| `src/app/api/workflow/route.ts` | API endpoints | Replace mock responses |
| `src/stores/workflow-store.ts` | State management | Replace simulations |
| `src/lib/database.ts` | Database services | Replace mock data |
| `src/lib/supabase.ts` | Supabase client | ‚úÖ Already configured |

## üéØ Success Criteria

1. **Database Tables**: All required tables exist and are accessible
2. **API Functionality**: POST requests save real data to Supabase
3. **Data Persistence**: Workflow sessions persist between browser sessions
4. **Error Handling**: Proper error messages for database failures
5. **Test Verification**: `test-database.js` passes all checks

## üîç Verification Commands

```bash
# Test database connectivity and operations
node test-database.js

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build and test production
npm run build
```

## üìö Additional Context

- **Supabase Configuration**: Already set up in `src/utils/supabase/info.tsx`
- **Environment**: Vercel deployment working, local development ready
- **Dependencies**: All required packages installed (including `node-fetch` for testing)
- **UI/UX**: Fully functional, no frontend changes needed
- **Authentication**: Not implemented yet (future consideration)

The next coding agent should focus on database integration while preserving the existing UI functionality. The application architecture is solid; it just needs to connect to real data storage instead of mock implementations.

In the next carryover file: system/context-carry-info-09-19-25-528pm.md write a spec to get this done. Delete any sections which are not relevant.


2. **Section Updates**
   - REQUIRED sections must always be included and fully populated
   - CONDITIONAL sections should only be included if relevant criteria are met
   - You MUST remove any sections marked CONDITIONAL if you don't update those sections because they don't have relevant content
   - Maintain consistent formatting within each section

3. **Content Requirements**
   - All file paths must be from workspace root
   - All task IDs must include both ID and title
   - All descriptions must be specific and actionable
   - All next steps must include clear success criteria

4. **Context Preservation**
   - Include any critical context from the current session
   - Reference relevant documentation and specifications
   - Maintain links between related tasks and components
   - Document any decisions or changes that affect future work

After updating the sections, review the entire file to ensure:
1. All REQUIRED sections are present and complete
2. All CONDITIONAL sections are either properly populated or removed
3. All formatting is consistent
4. All references and links are valid
5. The context is sufficient for a new session to continue the work
