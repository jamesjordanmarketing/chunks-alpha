# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 06-25-25-1108PM
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**Current Task**: T-2.4.5: Touch Interaction and Accessibility Documentation

You are implementing comprehensive touch interaction and accessibility documentation for the Aplio Design System modernization project. This task builds directly upon the successful completion and validation of T-2.4.4: Navigation Responsive Behavior Documentation, which established the proven 5-file documentation pattern that achieved production certification.

**Implementation Location**: `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/responsive/touch/`

**Critical Success Pattern**: T-2.4.4 validation demonstrated that the 5-file documentation structure (~51KB total) provides the optimal framework for comprehensive documentation tasks. You shall replicate this exact pattern:

1. **touch-definitions.md** (~14-16KB, 500+ lines) - Core touch patterns with TypeScript interfaces
2. **touch-implementation-guidelines.md** (~19-20KB, 700+ lines) - Comprehensive implementation patterns and code examples  
3. **touch-constraints-specifications.md** (~12KB, 540+ lines) - Technical constraints and performance specifications
4. **touch-testing-guide.md** (~1.3-4KB, 50+ lines) - Testing strategies and validation requirements
5. **touch-visual-reference.md** (~5-8KB, 120+ lines) - Visual examples and component anatomy

**Legacy Accuracy Requirement**: You must maintain 100% fidelity to legacy implementation patterns found in the specified reference files, exactly as T-2.4.4 achieved 100% accuracy to PrimaryNavbar.jsx patterns.

**Current Implementation State**: Task ready for immediate implementation - no blockers or dependencies outstanding.

### Critical Implementation Context

**T-2.4.4 Validation Success**: The comprehensive 5-phase documentation validation protocol has been successfully executed and certified production-ready. This provides the exact template and quality standards your T-2.4.5 implementation must achieve.

**Key Implementation Requirements**:
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: All touch accessibility documentation must comprehensively address WCAG 2.1 AA standards, following the proven pattern from T-2.4.4
- **TypeScript Strict Mode**: All code examples must compile successfully in strict mode, validated through the established compilation testing approach
- **Cross-Reference Integration**: Documentation must functionally integrate with T-2.4.1 (breakpoints), T-2.4.2 (layouts), T-2.4.3 (components), and T-2.4.4 (navigation)
- **Touch-Specific Focus**: Unlike navigation patterns, touch documentation requires specialized focus on mobile/tablet gesture interactions, touch target sizing (44px minimum), and hover alternatives

### Existing Implementation Instructions Adaptations

**Documentation Pattern Proven**: T-2.4.4's 5-file structure achieved production certification and established the definitive documentation approach. You shall apply this identical pattern to touch interaction documentation.

**Legacy Reference Validation**: T-2.4.4 demonstrated 100% accuracy validation against legacy code patterns. You must implement equivalent accuracy validation against the specified touch interaction legacy references:
- `aplio-legacy/components/shared/SwiperSlider.jsx` lines 4-5 (touch interactions)
- `aplio-legacy/components/navbar/PrimaryNavbar.jsx` lines 110-122 (touch targets)  
- `aplio-legacy/scss/_common.scss` lines 26-38 (hover alternatives)
- `aplio-legacy/components/navbar/PrimaryNavbar.jsx` lines 47-112 (accessibility considerations)

**Accessibility Standards Integration**: T-2.4.4 validated comprehensive WCAG 2.1 AA integration. You must enhance this approach with touch-specific accessibility requirements including screen reader support for touch interactions, keyboard alternatives for touch gestures, and focus management for touch interfaces.

### Modified Implementation Approaches

**Touch-Specific Documentation Requirements**: Unlike T-2.4.4's navigation focus, T-2.4.5 requires specialized documentation of:
- **Touch Target Sizing**: Minimum 44px touch targets with proper spacing guidelines
- **Gesture Pattern Documentation**: Swipe, pinch, long press, and multi-touch interaction patterns
- **Hover Alternative Systems**: Mobile-first alternatives for desktop hover states
- **Touch Feedback Systems**: Visual and haptic feedback implementation guidelines

**Mobile-First Enhancement**: While T-2.4.4 documented responsive behavior, T-2.4.5 must emphasize mobile-first touch interaction design with desktop compatibility, not responsive adaptation.

**Performance Specifications**: Touch interactions require specialized performance documentation including touch response latency (< 100ms), gesture recognition accuracy, and battery impact considerations not present in T-2.4.4.

### Additional Implementation Requirements

**Touch Accessibility Testing**: Beyond T-2.4.4's accessibility validation, T-2.4.5 requires specialized testing approaches for:
- Switch control compatibility for touch alternatives
- Voice control integration with touch interfaces  
- Touch assist technologies compatibility
- Cognitive accessibility for complex gesture patterns

**Cross-Device Consistency**: Documentation must address touch interaction consistency across phones, tablets, and touch-enabled laptops with different screen sizes and input methods.

**Framework Integration**: All touch patterns must provide implementation guidance for Next.js 14 App Router with React 18's concurrent features, building upon T-2.4.4's established React component patterns.

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The second context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)
- The third context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v3.js` (created when the second got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Add Structured Test Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js test-approach
