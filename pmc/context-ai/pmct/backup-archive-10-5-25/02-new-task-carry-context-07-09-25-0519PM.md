# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-07-10 17:23 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.1.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**Task:** T-3.3.2 Desktop Navigation Implementation

**What is being worked on:**
Implementation of desktop navigation menu with dropdown functionality, building upon the foundation architecture established and validated in T-3.3.1. This task creates the visual navigation components that users will interact with on desktop devices.

**Why it is being worked on:**
T-3.3.1 Navigation Component Structure and Types has been successfully completed and thoroughly tested through comprehensive Phases 1-5 testing. The foundation architecture (8 TypeScript files, 530+ lines of interfaces, 90%+ test coverage) is validated and ready for extension. T-3.3.2 represents the first visual implementation building on this solid foundation.

**Current state of implementation:**
T-3.3.2 has not been started. The task requires:
- Desktop navigation component creation using the validated T-3.3.1 foundation
- Dropdown menu functionality with animations matching legacy design
- Active state detection and styling
- Full ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support

**Critical context needed for continuation:**
- T-3.3.1 foundation architecture is complete, tested, and validated for extension
- Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces (530+ lines) are ready for desktop implementation
- Enhanced testing infrastructure is proven and ready for T-3.3.2 testing
- Client/server boundaries are optimized for Next.js 14 performance
- DSAP (Design System Adherence Protocol) compliance is mandatory for all new components

Do not deviate from this focus without explicit instruction.

## Task Summary: T-3.3.1 Navigation Component Structure and Types - COMPLETED

T-3.3.1 Navigation Component Structure and Types has been successfully implemented and validated through comprehensive 5-phase testing (Phases 0-4). The task established foundational navigation architecture with 8 TypeScript files containing 530+ lines of comprehensive interface definitions. All components compile successfully with TypeScript, achieve 90%+ test coverage, and maintain 100% DSAP compliance. The foundation architecture is validated as ready for T-3.3.2 Desktop Navigation and T-3.3.3 Mobile Navigation extension. Critical architectural screenshots and test artifacts have been generated and archived, providing complete documentation of the infrastructure-focused foundation implementation.

## Critical Implementation Context

### Foundation Architecture Validation Complete
- **8 TypeScript Components Implemented**: All navigation foundation files created and validated
- **530+ Lines of TypeScript Interfaces**: Comprehensive type system ready for implementation
- **Client/Server Boundaries Optimized**: Next.js 14 App Router patterns properly implemented
- **Testing Infrastructure Proven**: Enhanced testing protocol successfully executed through 5 phases
- **DSAP Compliance Achieved**: 100% design system adherence with pattern P013-LAYOUT-COMPONENT and P005-COMPONENT-TYPES validated

### Component Architecture Ready for Extension
- **High Priority Components Validated**: Navigation.types.ts, useNavigationState.ts, useStickyNavigation.ts all tested and ready
- **Integration Points Confirmed**: NavigationProvider.tsx and Navigation.tsx architectural patterns established
- **Extension Placeholders Ready**: DesktopNavigation.tsx and MobileNavigation.tsx foundation components prepared for implementation

### Testing Infrastructure Established
- **Enhanced Testing Protocol**: 5-phase testing methodology proven effective for navigation components
- **Architectural Validation Approach**: Error scaffold generation and boundary visualization techniques established
- **Performance Testing Capability**: Client/server boundary validation and TypeScript compilation testing ready

## Existing Implementation Instructions Adaptations

### Enhanced Component Path Resolution Required
The T-3.3.1 testing revealed component path resolution issues where scaffolds looked in `app/_components` vs `components/navigation/`. You must ensure T-3.3.2 implementation follows the established `components/navigation/Desktop/` path structure exactly as validated in T-3.3.1.

### Proven Architecture Patterns Available
You must leverage the validated architectural patterns from T-3.3.1:
- **TypeScript Interface Usage**: Use the comprehensive interfaces in `Navigation.types.ts` (530+ lines) 
- **Client Component Boundaries**: Follow the established pattern where hooks are client components
- **Modular Structure**: Maintain the proven directory organization of `Desktop/`, `Mobile/`, `Shared/`, `hooks/`, `types/`

### Testing Approach Adaptation
You must adapt the T-3.3.1 testing methodology for T-3.3.2 visual components:
- **Infrastructure vs Visual Focus**: T-3.3.2 requires visual/functional testing unlike T-3.3.1's architectural focus
- **Enhanced Scaffold Generation**: Component path resolution must be corrected for functional scaffold generation
- **Integration Testing**: Leverage the proven navigation module integration patterns from T-3.3.1

## Modified Implementation Approaches

### Foundation-First Implementation Strategy
Do NOT start from scratch. You must build directly upon the validated T-3.3.1 foundation:
- **Extend DesktopNavigation.tsx**: The placeholder component is ready for full implementation
- **Use Existing Type Definitions**: Leverage the comprehensive interfaces already defined and tested
- **Follow Established Patterns**: Maintain the architectural patterns proven in T-3.3.1 testing

### Component Integration Approach
You must use the validated integration architecture:
- **NavigationProvider Context**: Use the established provider pattern for state management
- **Navigation State Hooks**: Leverage useNavigationState.ts and useStickyNavigation.ts as designed
- **Barrel Export Structure**: Maintain the proven index.tsx export pattern

### Testing Strategy Modification
You must adapt testing for visual components:
- **Functional Scaffold Generation**: Fix component path resolution for working scaffolds
- **Visual Testing Focus**: Unlike T-3.3.1's architectural focus, T-3.3.2 requires functional UI testing
- **Enhanced Coverage Requirements**: Build upon the 90%+ coverage achieved in T-3.3.1

## Eliminated Requirements

### Foundation Architecture Creation
Do NOT recreate foundational architecture. The following T-3.3.1 deliverables are complete and validated:
- **Directory Structure Creation**: Navigation directory structure already exists and tested
- **TypeScript Interface Definition**: 530+ lines of comprehensive interfaces ready for use
- **Client/Server Boundary Setup**: Optimization already implemented and validated
- **Basic Component Structure**: Foundation components exist and architectural patterns proven

### Infrastructure-Only Testing
Do NOT limit testing to architectural validation. T-3.3.2 requires:
- **Functional UI Testing**: Unlike T-3.3.1's error scaffolds, T-3.3.2 needs working component testing
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Desktop navigation appearance must be validated
- **Interaction Testing**: Dropdown functionality and animations must be tested

## Additional Testing Needs

### Enhanced Scaffold Testing
You must implement functional scaffold testing that was not possible in T-3.3.1:
- **Working Component Scaffolds**: Fix path resolution to generate functional scaffolds for desktop navigation
- **Dropdown Interaction Testing**: Test dropdown menu functionality that wasn't part of T-3.3.1 infrastructure
- **Animation Testing**: Validate dropdown animations using the enhanced testing infrastructure

### Visual Regression Requirements
You must implement visual testing not required for T-3.3.1:
- **Desktop Layout Validation**: Ensure navigation appears correctly on desktop viewports
- **Responsive Behavior Testing**: Validate desktop-specific responsive patterns
- **Legacy Design Fidelity**: Compare visual output with legacy navigation implementation

### Performance Testing Enhancement
You must extend performance testing beyond T-3.3.1's compilation validation:
- **Dropdown Animation Performance**: Test 60fps animation requirements
- **Navigation State Performance**: Validate rapid state change handling in desktop context
- **Client/Server Optimization**: Test the established boundaries under desktop interaction load

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
