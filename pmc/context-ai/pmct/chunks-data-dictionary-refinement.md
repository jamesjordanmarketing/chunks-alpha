This is a great question and it clear now that we must filter/separate the dimensions that we must actually generate from those that are not necessary to generate. We will not generate all of them obviously.

So now...before we go forward do this:

Read my answers to your questions here: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\BRun\chunks-alpha\pmc\context-ai\pmct\08-chunk-build-analysis-01.md` as the answers may help with this exercise.

Then breakdown the master data dictionary 


Is simple object level meta data that is carried over from the parent document or belonging, category, tags data and is NOT generated during the chunk stage, but is still needed for the tables to work and reference objects.
This will include columns such as Doc_ID, Doc_Title, Author, etc...


Is simple object level meta data that is NOT carried over from the parent document or belonging, category, tags data. It MUST be generated during the chunk stage, and is needed for the tables to work and reference objects, but is a mechanically calculated or randomly generated. This will include such columns as
This will include columns such as Chunk_ID, Token_Count, Vector_Checksum, etc...


Is a dimension that requires thinking and AI generation. Each of these dimensions are required to be generated by a LLM. Each dimension does not necessarily need it's own prompt. Multiple dimensions can be generated by one prompt if it is appropriate. In fact I would say that in our engineering we should if possible try to construct prompts that will return structured data that provides answers to more than one dimension. Quality has a priority over efficiency though. If a dimension quality will suffer by being bundled it should not be bundled. 
This is dimensions such as Chunk_Type, Scenario_Type, Coverage_Tag, etc.
