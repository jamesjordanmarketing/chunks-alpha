# Chunk Alpha Detaild Specs

## Introduction
This task is to take all of this module's unstructured specifications that are currently in unstructured format, across several files, and even contained within a the codebase and write up one final specification that will take everything we have documented in the various files and build one detailed and comprehensive specification which will build the new chunk-alpha module.

## Task Driver
This document is the driver of this specification creation.  It's only purpose is to provide a roadmap to reading the unstructured specifications that are contained in the file paths within this document.
You MUST read every file in this document as well as you MUST read EVERY file that the specs in these file paths. Reading all of them slowly and a high level of attention to detail is the ONLY way you will be able to produce the comprehensive structured specification we need. 

## Foundational Documentations

First read the foundational documentations for this project:

I need you to read the product overview here:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\product\01-bmo-overview.md`

and then read the current Category module overview here:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\product\01-bmo-overview-categ-module_v1.md`

Then become intimately related to the code base of the module we are building on top of:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\src`

## 1. Existing Specs

Here is the full unstructured specification for this module here:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\context-ai\pmct\09-unstructured-chunks-module-alpha_v2.md`
We have a review analysis of this spec here:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\context-ai\pmct\08-chunk-build-analysis-01.md`

## 2. New Dimension Breakdown Data Dictionary Files

`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\system\chunks-alpha-data\document-metadata-dictionary-gen-AI-processing-required_v1.csv`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\system\chunks-alpha-data\document-metadata-dictionary-mechanically-generated_v1.csv`
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\system\chunks-alpha-data\document-metadata-dictionary-previously-generated_v1.csv`

Here are the original dimensions in one file :
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\system\chunks-alpha-data\document-metadata-dictionary.csv`

**Requirement:** ALL of these dimensions must be displayed on the output web page spreadsheet from this module version.

## 3. Directions on How We Must Use These New Data Dimensions and Engineering

`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\context-ai\pmct\c-alpha-data-dimensions-segmenting_v1.md`


## Final Specification Request

Now I need you to generate a final specification that the AI coding agent will use to develop this module.

**This task specification must:**

a. Be have sections which:
i. Include the steps to have the human cut and paste all of the needed SQL in the Supabase SQL Editor
ii. Include the prompt(s) will use the Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking LLM to execute the product build and coding changes. I must be able to cut and paste these prompts into a 200k Claude-4.5-sonnet Thinking context window in Cursor.
iii. Organize the successive prompts so that each one builds on the previous ones and can be executed in a new 200k token context window
iv. Remember All chunk metadata, referential data, factual data, tags, labels, and generated dimensions content should be saved to well structured, normalized, human readable named and organized Supabase tables.

## Deliverable Path

Ok please create the detailed new step by step build spec and put it here:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\brun\chunks-alpha\pmc\context-ai\pmct\c-alpha-build-spec_v3.md`
