# AI Implementation Agent Conductor Prompt - T-3.2.2

## Mission Overview
You are implementing T-3.2.2 AccordionItem component with expand/collapse animations and accessibility features. This task builds directly upon the successfully completed T-3.2.1 testing infrastructure (98.7% confidence) and leverages proven testing frameworks.

## Essential Context Integration
**CRITICAL**: You must read and understand these TWO complementary files that provide complete context:

1. **Primary Task Instructions**: `pmc/core/active-task.md`
   - Contains detailed T-3.2.2 implementation requirements, acceptance criteria, and phase-by-phase instructions
   - Includes Design System Adherence Protocol (DSAP) requirements
   - Provides complete task approach with confidence level 8/10

2. **Implementation Context**: `system/plans/new-panels/02-new-task-carry-context-07-06-25-1144PM.md`
   - Contains critical context from T-3.2.1 completion (testing infrastructure, component architecture)
   - Provides key files, testing approach, and technical context needed for T-3.2.2
   - Explains how to leverage existing testing infrastructure and component foundations

**These files complement each other** - the active task provides the "what" and "how", while the carry-over context provides the "why" and "building upon what".

## Implementation Protocol

### Phase 1: Context Preparation
1. **Read both context files completely** before beginning any implementation
2. **Understand the relationship**: T-3.2.2 builds upon T-3.2.1's accordion structure and testing infrastructure
3. **Identify key integration points**: AccordionProvider Context, testing framework, legacy reference patterns
4. **Verify DSAP requirements**: This is a design-related task requiring full DSAP compliance

### Phase 2: Execute Active Task
1. **Follow the active task instructions precisely** - all phases (PREP, IMP, VAL) with required CLI commands
2. **Leverage T-3.2.1 foundations**: Use existing component structure, testing infrastructure, and proven patterns
3. **Apply carry-over insights**: Use technical context about animations, accessibility, and testing approaches
4. **Maintain quality standards**: 90% test coverage, 95% confidence visual analysis, comprehensive documentation

### Phase 3: Testing Integration
1. **Use proven testing infrastructure** from T-3.2.1 (enhanced LLM vision analysis, visual scaffolds)
2. **Create T-3.2.2 specific tests** while leveraging existing framework patterns
3. **Generate required reports** following T-3.2.1 template structure
4. **Execute comprehensive validation** including accessibility, animations, and visual regression

## Success Criteria Alignment
- **Component Implementation**: AccordionItem with smooth animations and accessibility compliance
- **Context Integration**: Proper use of T-3.2.1 AccordionProvider and component architecture
- **Testing Coverage**: 90% minimum coverage with comprehensive test suite
- **Documentation**: Complete reports following proven T-3.2.1 template structure
- **Quality Assurance**: Meet all acceptance criteria with high confidence validation

## Key Reminders
- **PMC CLI Commands**: Run from pmc directory using `node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js [command]`
- **Phase Updates**: Use required CLI commands at each phase completion
- **DSAP Compliance**: Complete all three steps (Discovery, Implementation, Reporting)
- **Legacy Reference**: Use `aplio-legacy/components/shared/FaqItem.jsx` for animation patterns
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Leverage existing framework with enhanced LLM vision analysis

## Context Relationship
The carry-over context explains **why** certain approaches work (based on T-3.2.1 success), while the active task explains **how** to implement T-3.2.2 specifically. Together, they provide complete implementation guidance for building upon proven foundations while meeting new requirements.

Execute the instructions in `pmc/core/active-task.md` with full awareness of the technical context and infrastructure established in T-3.2.1.
