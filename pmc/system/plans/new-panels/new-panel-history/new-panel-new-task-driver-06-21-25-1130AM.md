=========================Prompt=For=Building=Context=========================================
You are tasked with updating the context carryover file at:
system\plans\new-panels\new-panel-new-task-driver-06-21-25-1130AM.md

First, read the entire file to understand its current structure and content.

Next update system\plans\new-panels\new-panel-new-task-driver-06-21-25-1130AM.md to prepare the next agent to start the next task.  

Read system\plans\new-panels\new-panel-new-task-driver-06-21-25-1130AM.md first to understand how to update it correctly. Remove any sections not used.

Your main task is to recap everything we have accomplished and executed in this prompt. Including:
   - Include any critical context from the current session
   - Reference relevant documentation and specifications
   - Maintain links between related tasks and components
   - Document any decisions or changes that affect future work
   - mention any variations you made to the task testing which are important to know.
   - Update the appropriate sections in pmc\system\plans\context-carries\context-carry-info-06-19-25-1111pm.md 

The Active Development Focus for the next agent is we are going to start executing the task in sequence after we just completed here in this chat. Review the entire steps and actions completed here and examine any possible gaps in what the task development requirements are. Review the next task here: pmc\core\active-task.md. I have updated it to Task T-2.2.4

Then examine what was completed in this task. Look for requirements gaps.

Do NOT attempt to fix or add any code or content to this task. We will hand it over to the unit testing engineer.  

Give a detailed and comprehensive documentation of what you have done in the test so far.

One more reminder. Your job is ONLY to update pmc\system\plans\context-carries\context-carry-info-06-19-25-1111pm.md  with an in depth context build of all of the information it will need to fully analyze the prompts document.


Then, update the "Current Focus" section with the following requirements:

1. **Active Development Focus**
   - Be explicit about the task
   - Include full paths where applicable

You are not going to execute the below. Your task is to update: system\plans\new-panels\new-panel-new-task-driver-06-21-25-1130AM.md with the details of what I am requesting below:

CONTENT

In the next carryover file: system\plans\new-panels\new-panel-new-task-driver-06-21-25-1130AM.md write a spec to get this done. Delete any sections which are not relevant.


2. **Section Updates**
   - REQUIRED sections must always be included and fully populated
   - CONDITIONAL sections should only be included if relevant criteria are met
   - You MUST remove any sections marked CONDITIONAL if you don't update those sections because they don't have relevant content
   - Maintain consistent formatting within each section

3. **Content Requirements**
   - All file paths must be from workspace root
   - All task IDs must include both ID and title
   - All descriptions must be specific and actionable
   - All next steps must include clear success criteria

4. **Context Preservation**
   - Include any critical context from the current session
   - Reference relevant documentation and specifications
   - Maintain links between related tasks and components
   - Document any decisions or changes that affect future work

5. **Human Context Input**
   If provided, incorporate the following human-supplied context:
   ```
   <human_context>
   NEXT_STEPS: [Brief description of intended next steps]
   FOCUS_AREAS: [Specific areas requiring attention]
   CONCERNS: [Any issues or concerns to address]
   NOTES: [Additional context or instructions]
   </human_context>

After updating the sections, review the entire file to ensure:
1. All REQUIRED sections are present and complete
2. All CONDITIONAL sections are either properly populated or removed
3. All formatting is consistent
4. All references and links are valid
5. The context is sufficient for a new session to continue the work
