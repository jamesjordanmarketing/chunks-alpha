ok. finally we need to update the carryover file to prepare the next agent to work.  

You will add all of the appropriate information here:
system\plans\new-panels\new-panel-new-task-06-10-25-0336PM.md

read that file first to understand how to update it correctly. Remove any sections not used.

Your main task is to recap everything we have accomplished and executed in this prompt. Including:
   - Include any critical context from the current session
   - Reference relevant documentation and specifications
   - Maintain links between related tasks and components
   - Document any decisions or changes that affect future work
   - mention any variations you made to the task testing which are important to know.
   - Update the appropriate sections in system\plans\new-panels\new-panel-new-task-06-10-25-0336PM.md

The Active Development Focus for the next agent is we are going to start executing the task in sequence after we just completed here in this chat. Review the entire steps and actions completed here and examine any possible gaps in what the task development requirements are. Review the next task here: pmc\core\active-task.md. I have updated it to contain the specifications for the next task in sequence.

Then examine what was completed in this task. Look for requirements gaps.

Do NOT attempt to fix or add any code or content to this task. We will hand it over to the unit testing engineer.  

Give a detailed and comprehensive documentation of what you have done in the test so far.

One more reminder. Your job is ONLY to update system\plans\new-panels\new-panel-new-task-06-10-25-0336PM.md with an in depth context build of all of the information it will need to fully analyze the prompts document.
