# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 06-25-25-1102AM
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**T-2.4.2 Responsive Layout Pattern Documentation - Implementation Preparation**

**What is being worked on**: Implementing T-2.4.2 Responsive Layout Pattern Documentation following the successful completion and production certification of T-2.4.1 Breakpoint System Documentation. This task builds directly on T-2.4.1's comprehensive breakpoint system foundation to document responsive layout patterns and grid systems.

**Why it is being worked on**: T-2.4.2 is the next critical component in the responsive design system documentation sequence. With T-2.4.1's breakpoint system now providing the foundational responsive framework (2,747 lines of production-certified documentation), T-2.4.2 must document how layouts adapt and respond within these established breakpoints to complete the responsive documentation foundation.

**Current state of implementation**: T-2.4.1 has been completed and production certified with all 8 success criteria validated. The implementation agent must now leverage T-2.4.1's proven 5-file documentation pattern and integrate with the established breakpoint system to document responsive layout patterns.

**Critical context for continuation**: T-2.4.1 established the proven documentation pattern that must be replicated exactly for T-2.4.2. The breakpoint system provides the foundation that layout patterns must reference and integrate with.

### Current Active Action

**Task ID**: T-2.4.2 
**Current Phase**: Preparation (Pre-Implementation)
**Active Element**: Initial task setup and legacy analysis preparation
**Last Recorded Action**: Task automation setup completed, context carryover in progress

### Recent Development Context

- **Last Milestone**: T-2.4.1 Breakpoint System Documentation completed and production certified
- **Key Outcomes**: 
  - Established proven 5-file documentation pattern for responsive system components
  - Created comprehensive TypeScript validation methodology with strict mode compliance
  - Achieved 100% legacy accuracy to `aplio-legacy/tailwind.config.js` configuration
  - Successful integration with T-2.3.5 accessibility documentation patterns
- **Relevant Learnings**: 
  - 5-file documentation structure proves highly effective for comprehensive coverage
  - TypeScript strict mode validation requires proper code extraction and compilation testing
  - Legacy reference accuracy demands exact line number validation and systematic updates
  - Cross-reference integration requires careful path management and validation
- **Technical Context**: 
  - Breakpoint system provides responsive foundation at `design-system/docs/responsive/breakpoints/`
  - Established validation protocols can be directly applied to T-2.4.2
  - Legacy components contain layout patterns that must be extracted and documented
  - Integration with accessibility patterns (T-2.3.5) is essential for complete coverage

## Critical Implementation Context

### T-2.4.1 Success Factors to Replicate

**1. Proven 5-File Documentation Pattern** (CRITICAL):
T-2.4.1 achieved production certification using a specific 5-file structure that must be exactly replicated for T-2.4.2:
- Primary definitions file (core patterns and values)
- Implementation guidelines file (usage patterns and examples)
- Constraints/specifications file (technical specifications)
- Testing guide file (validation and testing approaches)
- Visual reference file (examples and demonstrations)

**2. Legacy Reference Accuracy Protocol** (CRITICAL):
T-2.4.1 required systematic correction of line number references and achieved 100% accuracy. T-2.4.2 must:
- Verify exact line numbers in legacy component references
- Cross-validate all extracted patterns against source implementations
- Maintain accuracy to legacy layout implementations in Feature.jsx and PrimaryNavbar.jsx

**3. TypeScript Strict Mode Compliance** (CRITICAL):
T-2.4.1 established TypeScript validation methodology requiring:
- All code examples must compile with TypeScript strict mode
- Proper code extraction from documentation to avoid markdown parsing issues
- Creation of validation files to test compilation success

### Modified Implementation Approaches

**1. Layout Documentation Must Integrate with Breakpoint System**:
Unlike T-2.4.1 which established the breakpoint foundation, T-2.4.2 must reference and integrate with existing breakpoints. All layout patterns must specify behavior at each breakpoint defined in T-2.4.1.

**2. Cross-Reference Integration Required**:
T-2.4.2 must maintain functional cross-references to:
- T-2.4.1 breakpoint documentation for responsive behavior specifications
- T-2.3.5 accessibility documentation for layout accessibility considerations
- Legacy component implementations for pattern validation

**3. Mobile-First Methodology Continuation**:
T-2.4.1 established mobile-first documentation approach that must be continued in T-2.4.2 layout patterns.

### Eliminated Requirements

**Documentation Pattern Research**: T-2.4.1 established the proven 5-file pattern, eliminating the need for T-2.4.2 to research documentation structure approaches.

**TypeScript Validation Methodology**: T-2.4.1 created the complete validation framework, eliminating the need for T-2.4.2 to develop new testing approaches.

### Additional Testing Needs

**1. Layout-Breakpoint Integration Validation**:
T-2.4.2 must validate that all documented layout patterns properly reference and work within T-2.4.1's established breakpoint system.

**2. Cross-Reference Validation**:
Testing must verify that all links between layout documentation and breakpoint system function correctly.

**3. Legacy Pattern Accuracy**:
Comprehensive validation against legacy component implementations to ensure documented patterns match actual usage.

### Acceptance Criteria Enhancements

Beyond the documented acceptance criteria in `active-task.md`, T-2.4.2 must achieve:

**1. T-2.4.1 Integration Compliance**:
All layout patterns must properly reference and integrate with the established breakpoint system.

**2. Production Certification Standards**:
T-2.4.2 must achieve the same production certification standards as T-2.4.1, including comprehensive validation report and completion certificate.

**3. TypeScript Strict Mode Validation**:
All layout-related code examples must compile successfully with TypeScript strict mode, following T-2.4.1's validation methodology.

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The second context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)
- The third context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v3.js` (created when the second got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Add Structured Test Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js test-approach
