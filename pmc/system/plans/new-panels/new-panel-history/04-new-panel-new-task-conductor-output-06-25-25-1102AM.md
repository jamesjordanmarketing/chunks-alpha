# AI Implementation Agent Conductor Prompt - T-2.4.2 Responsive Layout Pattern Documentation

Your mission is to implement **T-2.4.2 Responsive Layout Pattern Documentation** following the proven success patterns established by T-2.4.1 Breakpoint System Documentation. Follow these steps precisely:

## Critical Context Integration

**ESSENTIAL READING ORDER** (Read these files in this exact sequence):

1. **Context Foundation**: `system\plans\new-panels\02-new-task-carry-context-06-25-25-1102AM.md`
   - Contains critical T-2.4.1 completion context and T-2.4.2 implementation guidance
   - Provides proven patterns that MUST be replicated for T-2.4.2 success
   - Details integration requirements with existing breakpoint system

2. **Task Specification**: `pmc\core\active-task.md` 
   - Contains T-2.4.2 implementation requirements, acceptance criteria, and phases
   - Complements the carryover context with specific task elements

**Key Integration Points**:
- The carryover context provides the **HOW** (proven patterns from T-2.4.1)
- The active task provides the **WHAT** (T-2.4.2 specific requirements)
- Both documents are complementary and essential for success

## Implementation Process

### Step 1: Generate Task Approach
1. Read `pmc\system\coding-prompts\02-task-approach-prompt.md`
2. Execute the task approach generation immediately
3. **CRITICAL**: Integrate the proven 5-file documentation pattern from T-2.4.1 (detailed in carryover context)
4. Ensure your approach references T-2.4.1 breakpoint integration requirements

### Step 2: Integrate Task Approach
1. Verify you are in the `pmc` directory
2. Execute exactly: `node bin\aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach`
3. Verify completion by checking for "Added:" notation in the Task Approach section of `active-task.md`
4. **If the command fails, STOP and request human assistance**

### Step 3: Execute T-2.4.2 Implementation

**Implementation Location**: `aplio-modern-1\design-system\docs\responsive\layouts\`

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS** (from T-2.4.1 proven pattern):

1. **Replicate Exact 5-File Structure**:
   - Follow the exact pattern documented in carryover context
   - Integrate with T-2.4.1 breakpoint system at `design-system\docs\responsive\breakpoints\`

2. **Legacy Reference Accuracy**:
   - Verify exact line numbers in `aplio-legacy\components\home-4\Feature.jsx` (lines 38-39)
   - Validate mobile patterns in `aplio-legacy\components\navbar\PrimaryNavbar.jsx` (lines 110-122)
   - Achieve 100% accuracy to legacy implementations

3. **TypeScript Strict Mode Compliance**:
   - All layout code examples must compile with TypeScript strict mode
   - Use T-2.4.1's proven validation methodology from carryover context

4. **Cross-Reference Integration**:
   - Maintain functional links to T-2.4.1 breakpoint documentation
   - Ensure T-2.3.5 accessibility integration (detailed in carryover context)

**Execute Phases Systematically**:
- Complete all PREP phase steps first
- Execute IMP phase with pattern integration
- Validate through VAL phase using T-2.4.1 proven protocols
- Use all required PMC commands as specified in `active-task.md`

### Step 4: Production Certification Target

**T-2.4.2 must achieve the same production certification standards as T-2.4.1**:
- Comprehensive validation testing report
- TypeScript strict mode compliance verification  
- Complete integration validation with breakpoint system
- Production-ready completion certificate

## Critical Warnings

**DO NOT**:
- Deviate from the proven 5-file pattern established by T-2.4.1
- Skip legacy reference accuracy validation
- Ignore TypeScript strict mode requirements
- Proceed without reading both essential context documents

**ALWAYS**:
- Reference T-2.4.1 breakpoint system for responsive behavior
- Follow mobile-first methodology established in carryover context
- Validate all cross-references function correctly
- Use PMC commands exactly as specified

## Implementation Success Criteria

Beyond the acceptance criteria in `active-task.md`, you must achieve:

1. **T-2.4.1 Integration Compliance**: All layout patterns properly reference established breakpoint system
2. **Production Certification**: Same certification standards as T-2.4.1
3. **Pattern Accuracy**: 100% accuracy to legacy component implementations
4. **Documentation Quality**: Professional standards matching T-2.4.1's 2,747 lines

## Final Instructions

After completing VAL phase and the final `update-phase-stage "complete"` command:
- **STOP immediately** 
- **Await human operator instructions** for unit testing
- Do NOT proceed beyond task completion without explicit instruction

**Your success depends on leveraging the proven T-2.4.1 patterns while implementing T-2.4.2 specific requirements. The carryover context is your blueprint for success.**
