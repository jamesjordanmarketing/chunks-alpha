# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 06-25-25-0846PM
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0
**Task Transition:** T-2.4.3 â†’ T-2.4.4

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**Task Summary**: T-2.4.3: Component-Specific Responsive Behavior Documentation has been successfully completed with production certification achieved through comprehensive 5-phase testing. The task created ~105KB of responsive behavior documentation across 5 files (component-definitions.md, component-implementation-guidelines.md, component-constraints-specifications.md, component-testing-guide.md, component-visual-reference.md) at `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/responsive/components/`. All documentation achieved 100% legacy accuracy validation against Hero, Feature, Card, and Slider components, with functional cross-reference integration to T-2.4.1 breakpoints and T-2.4.2 layouts, TypeScript strict mode compliance, and professional production-ready quality standards.

**Current Active Task**: T-2.4.4: Navigation Responsive Behavior Documentation
You shall implement comprehensive documentation for navigation responsive behaviors and mobile menu patterns for the Next.js 14 design system. The task requires creating documentation at `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/responsive/navigation/` covering desktop navigation, mobile navigation layouts, mobile menu patterns, and navigation transitions between breakpoints.

### Critical Implementation Context

**Proven Documentation Pattern**: T-2.4.3 successfully established a 5-file documentation pattern that achieved production certification:
1. **Core Definitions File** (~11KB, ~414 lines): Component responsive patterns with TypeScript interfaces
2. **Implementation Guidelines File** (~22KB, ~871 lines): Comprehensive implementation patterns and code examples
3. **Constraints Specifications File** (~17KB, ~831 lines): Technical constraints covering performance and accessibility
4. **Testing Guide File** (~27KB, ~961 lines): Testing strategies including unit, visual, and accessibility tests
5. **Visual Reference File** (~28KB, ~801 lines): Visual demonstrations with component anatomy diagrams

You must replicate this exact 5-file structure pattern for T-2.4.4 navigation documentation to ensure consistency and production certification readiness.

**Legacy Accuracy Requirements**: T-2.4.3 achieved 100% legacy accuracy by analyzing specific legacy code line references. For T-2.4.4, you must maintain the same standard by analyzing these navigation-specific legacy references:
- Desktop navigation: `aplio-legacy/components/navbar/PrimaryNavbar.jsx` lines 37-38
- Mobile navigation: `aplio-legacy/components/navbar/PrimaryNavbar.jsx` lines 110-122
- Mobile menu patterns: `aplio-legacy/components/navbar/PrimaryNavbar.jsx` lines 137-238
- Navigation transitions: `aplio-legacy/components/navbar/PrimaryNavbar.jsx` lines 110-122

### Existing Implementation Instructions Adaptations

**Cross-Reference Integration**: T-2.4.3 successfully integrated with T-2.4.1 breakpoint system and T-2.4.2 layout documentation. For T-2.4.4, you must extend this integration by also referencing T-2.4.3's component documentation where navigation components interact with Hero, Feature, Card, and Slider components.

**Testing Protocol Enhancement**: T-2.4.3 used a comprehensive 5-phase testing protocol (Pre-Testing Setup, Structure Validation, Legacy Accuracy, Cross-Reference Integration, TypeScript Compliance, Content Quality Assessment). You shall adapt this testing protocol for navigation-specific validation while maintaining the same rigorous standards.

**Quality Standards**: T-2.4.3 achieved production certification with these verified quality metrics:
- Mobile-first methodology consistently documented
- Dark mode considerations included throughout
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance documented
- Performance considerations documented
- 50+ code examples provided (5x minimum requirement)
- TypeScript strict mode compliance for all interfaces

### Modified Implementation Approaches

**Directory Structure**: Create `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/responsive/navigation/` following the established pattern, ensuring parallel structure to the proven `components/` directory from T-2.4.3.

**Documentation Scope**: Focus specifically on navigation responsive behaviors rather than general component behaviors. This includes mobile menu patterns, dropdown behaviors, navigation transitions, and accessibility patterns specific to navigation systems.

**Legacy Analysis Focus**: Shift from analyzing Hero/Feature/Card/Slider components to analyzing PrimaryNavbar.jsx navigation patterns, mobile menu implementations, and responsive breakpoint behaviors specific to navigation systems.

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The second context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)
- The third context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v3.js` (created when the second got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Add Structured Test Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js test-approach
```
