# T-2.3.2 AI Implementation Agent Conductor Prompt

## Mission Overview

You are tasked with implementing **T-2.3.2: Interactive Animation Pattern Documentation** following the successful pattern established by T-2.3.1, which achieved complete validation success (98/100 implementation readiness score). Your mission is to create comprehensive interactive animation documentation that will pass identical validation testing.

## Critical Context Understanding

**Two Complementary Documents Guide Your Implementation:**

1. **`pmc\core\active-task.md`** - Contains the official task specifications, acceptance criteria, and implementation phases for T-2.3.2
2. **`system\plans\new-panels\02-new-task-carry-context-06-23-25-1050PM.md`** - Contains critical success patterns from T-2.3.1 and implementation context

**These documents are complementary, not conflicting.** The active task provides the formal requirements, while the carryover context provides proven success patterns and quality standards you must meet.

## Implementation Sequence

### Step 1: Understand Success Requirements
1. **Read `system\plans\new-panels\02-new-task-carry-context-06-23-25-1050PM.md` FIRST**
   - Understand T-2.3.1's complete success pattern (100% legacy accuracy, comprehensive dark mode coverage)
   - Note the quality benchmarks: 104KB documentation, 98/100 readiness score
   - Review the specific success factors you must replicate

2. **Then Read `pmc\core\active-task.md`**
   - Understand T-2.3.2 specific requirements (hover, focus, click/tap, transitions)
   - Review the acceptance criteria and implementation phases
   - Note the legacy code references you must analyze

### Step 2: Generate Task Approach
1. **Read `pmc\system\coding-prompts\02-task-approach-prompt.md`**
2. **Execute those instructions immediately** to generate your implementation approach
3. **Navigate to pmc directory** (if not already there)
4. **Run the integration command:**
   ```bash
   node bin\aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
   ```
5. **Verify completion** by checking that the Task Approach section in `active-task.md` has an "Added:" notation

### Step 3: Execute T-2.3.2 Implementation
**Primary Objective:** Create interactive animation documentation in `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/interactive/` that matches T-2.3.1's success standards.

**Critical Success Requirements:**
- **100% legacy reference accuracy** (critical failure condition if violated)
- **Complete dark mode coverage** in all documentation files  
- **Implementation readiness â‰¥95/100** with comprehensive technical specifications
- **Consistent timing standards** following animation best practices
- **4-5 comprehensive documentation files** totaling 80-100KB

**Implementation Phases:**
1. **PREP Phase**: Analyze legacy code references for interactive patterns
2. **IMP Phase**: Create comprehensive documentation files with T-2.3.1 quality standards
3. **VAL Phase**: Validate documentation against success criteria

**Execute all phases as specified in `pmc\core\active-task.md`**, applying the quality standards and success patterns from the carryover context.

### Step 4: Maintain Quality Standards
**You must achieve T-2.3.1's success benchmarks:**
- Legacy reference accuracy: 100% (any inaccuracy = critical failure)
- Dark mode coverage: Comprehensive across all files (25+ references)
- Technical specifications: 200+ timing references minimum
- Integration examples: Extensive Framer Motion and React patterns
- File structure: Consistent markdown following T-2.3.1 pattern

### Step 5: Complete Implementation
1. **Execute all PREP, IMP, and VAL phases** as specified in active-task.md
2. **Run required PMC commands** for phase completion tracking
3. **Stop after VAL completion** and await testing instructions

## Key Success Factors from T-2.3.1

**Documentation Quality:** T-2.3.1 achieved 104KB of comprehensive documentation across 5 files. You must create equivalent quality for interactive animations.

**Legacy Accuracy:** 100% legacy reference validation was achieved. Any timing value, line number, or code pattern inaccuracy will result in validation failure.

**Implementation Readiness:** 98/100 score with 284 timing specifications, 352 Framer Motion integrations, and 95 React patterns. You must provide equivalent technical depth.

**Testing Readiness:** Your documentation will undergo identical 5-phase validation testing. Design for success from the beginning.

## Critical Reminders

- **Both documents are authoritative:** Use active-task.md for formal requirements, carryover context for quality standards
- **Follow T-2.3.1 success pattern:** Don't deviate from proven successful approach
- **Legacy accuracy is critical:** Any inaccuracy results in validation failure
- **Quality over speed:** Comprehensive documentation that passes validation is the goal
- **PMC commands from pmc directory:** Always navigate there for CLI commands
- **New bash shells ALWAYS open in pmc by default. Navigate accordingly when you start a new shell.

## Implementation Start

Begin by reading both context documents thoroughly, then proceed with Step 1. Your success depends on understanding both the specific T-2.3.2 requirements and the proven T-2.3.1 success pattern.

**Execute `pmc\core\active-task.md` as your primary implementation guide, enhanced by the quality standards and success patterns in the carryover context.**
