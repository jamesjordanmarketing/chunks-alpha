# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 07-14-25-1022AM
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**Task Summary**: T-3.3.2 Desktop Navigation Implementation has been completed successfully, creating a comprehensive desktop navigation component with dropdown functionality, active state management, and full accessibility support. This task built upon the T-3.3.1 Navigation Foundation Architecture (530+ lines of TypeScript interfaces, 8 validated TypeScript files) and implemented the DesktopNavigation.tsx component with complete dropdown menus, mega menu support, active state detection, and keyboard navigation. The component integrates seamlessly with the existing NavigationTypes interfaces, useNavigationState hook, and useStickyNavigation hook from the foundation architecture.

**Current Implementation Target**: T-3.3.3 Mobile Navigation Implementation
- **What is being worked on**: Implementing mobile navigation with hamburger menu and slide-in functionality
- **Why it is being worked on**: Mobile navigation is essential for responsive design and completes the navigation system started with T-3.3.1 foundation and T-3.3.2 desktop implementation
- **Current state of implementation**: Not started - ready for implementation phase
- **Critical context needed for continuation**: Must leverage the validated T-3.3.1 foundation architecture and integrate with the completed T-3.3.2 desktop navigation patterns

### Critical Implementation Context

**T-3.3.1 Foundation Architecture Integration**: You MUST utilize the comprehensive navigation foundation from T-3.3.1 including:
- NavigationTypes interfaces (530+ lines of TypeScript definitions)
- useNavigationState hook for state management
- useStickyNavigation hook for scroll behavior
- NavigationAccessibilityConfig specifications
- Component path resolution patterns (ensure proper imports)

**T-3.3.2 Desktop Navigation Patterns**: The completed desktop navigation established these patterns you must follow:
- Visual fidelity matching legacy PrimaryNavbar component
- Animation timing using duration-500 transitions
- ARIA attribute implementation following NavigationAccessibilityConfig
- Active state detection using router pathname matching
- Theme support with light/dark mode handling

**Design System Adherence Protocol (DSAP)**: MANDATORY compliance with all three steps:
1. **Documentation Discovery** (PREP Phase): Search all `/design-system/docs/navigation/` documentation
2. **Compliance Implementation** (IMP Phase): Follow discovered standards exactly
3. **Adherence Reporting** (VAL Phase): Create compliance report at test location

### Existing Implementation Instructions Adaptations

**Mobile-Specific Requirements Added**: Beyond the standard navigation patterns, you must implement:
- Hamburger button with smooth open/close animations
- Slide-in menu container with proper mobile touch targets
- Touch-friendly interaction patterns (minimum 44px touch targets)
- Mobile-specific accessibility considerations (gesture support, screen reader compatibility)

**Legacy Code Integration**: Reference the mobile navigation sections in:
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\navbar\PrimaryNavbar.jsx`:110-122 (hamburger button)
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\navbar\PrimaryNavbar.jsx`:137-238 (mobile menu container)
- `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\navbar\PrimaryNavbar.jsx`:137-145 (menu transitions)

**Component Integration Pattern**: You must create a mobile navigation component that integrates with the existing navigation architecture while maintaining clear separation from desktop navigation functionality.

### Modified Implementation Approaches

**Path Resolution Fix Required**: T-3.3.1 testing identified component path resolution issues in scaffold generation. You MUST ensure proper component imports and path resolution in your mobile navigation implementation.

**Animation Performance**: Implement mobile animations with 60fps performance standards and proper client/server boundaries for Next.js 14 optimization.

**Responsive Integration**: The mobile navigation must work seamlessly with the existing desktop navigation, showing/hiding appropriately based on breakpoints defined in the design system.

### Eliminated Requirements

**Dropdown Mega Menu Complexity**: Mobile navigation does not require the complex dropdown and mega menu functionality implemented in T-3.3.2. Focus on simplified mobile menu structure with slide-in behavior.

**Complex Hover States**: Mobile navigation should rely on touch/tap interactions rather than hover states implemented in desktop navigation.

### Additional Testing Needs

**Visual Regression Testing**: Implement screenshot comparison testing against legacy mobile navigation to ensure visual fidelity.

**Touch Target Validation**: Create specific tests for mobile touch target sizes (minimum 44px) and touch interaction patterns.

**Animation Performance Testing**: Validate that slide-in/out animations maintain 60fps performance on mobile devices.

**Accessibility Testing**: Enhanced mobile accessibility testing including gesture support and screen reader compatibility in mobile contexts.

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The second context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)
- The third context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v3.js` (created when the second got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Add Structured Test Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js test-approach
