5. [Test Result Summary](#test-result-summary)

## Overview
This file contains testing instructions for task T-1.1.1. 
Do NOT begin testing until you have completed all implementation steps in core/active-task.md.

- Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1`
- Test Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
- Testing Tools: Jest, TypeScript, npm scripts
- Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
   ```bash
   npm list jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```
   If any are missing, install them:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
   ```

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root:
   ```bash
   [ -f jest.config.js ] && echo "Jest config exists" || echo "Jest config missing"
   ```
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed:
   ```bash
   node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js check-dependency "None"
   ```

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

## Element Tests
### T-1.1.1:ELE-1
**Description**: Project initialization: Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support

#### Test Cases
1. [ ] Test initialization and setup
2. [ ] Test functionality
3. [ ] Test error handling

2. [ ] Test functionality
3. [ ] Test error handling

#### Implementation Notes
- Add notes about test implementation here

## Coverage Reporting
After running all tests with coverage, document the results here:

```bash
npx jest --coverage `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
```

- Overall coverage percentage: (fill in after running tests)
- Coverage by element:
      - T-1.1.1:ELE-1: 0%
    - T-1.1.1:ELE-2: 0%
- Areas needing additional coverage: (identify any areas below target)

If coverage requirements are not met:
1. Identify areas lacking coverage
2. Implement additional tests targeting those areas
3. Rerun tests and verify improved coverage

## Test Result Summary
- [ ] All tests have been executed
- [ ] All tests have passed
- [ ] Coverage requirements have been met
- [ ] Test failures have been documented and addressed
- [ ] Test fixtures have been properly managed

When all tests are complete, return to core/active-task.md to complete the task.

5. [Test Result Summary](#test-result-summary)

## Overview
This file contains testing instructions for task T-2.1.1. 
Do NOT begin testing until you have completed all implementation steps in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\active-task.md`.

- Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1\styles\design-tokens\colors.ts`
- Test Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-2-1\T-2.1.1\`
- Testing Tools: Jest, TypeScript, Storybook, Chromatic, Axe
- Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
   ```bash
   npm list jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```
   If any are missing, install them:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-2-1\T-2.1.1\`
   ```

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root:
   ```bash
   [ -f jest.config.js ] && echo "Jest config exists" || echo "Jest config missing"
   ```
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed:
   ```bash
   node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js check-dependency "T-1.1.0, T-1.2.0"
   ```

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

## Test Planning Workpad

As you develop and execute tests for this task, you may use the dedicated test workpad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-dev-workpad.md`

This workpad is your testing sandbox where you can:
- Design complex test cases before formal implementation
- Develop test fixtures and mock data
- Track test failures and debugging steps
- Plan test coverage strategies
- Document edge cases that need testing
- Work through test assertions and expected outcomes
- Track test-specific TODOs as you discover them

Using this workpad is optional but recommended for complex testing scenarios. Nothing written there will be considered final test code - it's purely to assist your testing process.

5. [Test Result Summary](#test-result-summary)

## Overview
This file contains testing instructions for task T-1.1.1. 
Do NOT begin testing until you have completed all implementation steps in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\active-task.md`.

- Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1`
- Test Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
- Testing Tools: Jest, TypeScript, npm scripts
- Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
   ```bash
   npm list jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```
   If any are missing, install them:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
   ```

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root:
   ```bash
   [ -f jest.config.js ] && echo "Jest config exists" || echo "Jest config missing"
   ```
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed:
   ```bash
   node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js check-dependency "None"
   ```

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

## Test Planning Workpad

As you develop and execute tests for this task, you may use the dedicated test workpad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-work-pad-test.md`

This workpad is your testing sandbox where you can:
- Design complex test cases before formal implementation
- Develop test fixtures and mock data
- Track test failures and debugging steps
- Plan test coverage strategies
- Document edge cases that need testing
- Work through test assertions and expected outcomes
- Track test-specific TODOs as you discover them

Using this workpad is optional but recommended for complex testing scenarios. Nothing written there will be considered final test code - it's purely to assist your testing process.

When using the workpad, consider organizing your entries by element and test case to maintain clarity as you work through the testing requirements.

## Element Tests
### T-1.1.1:ELE-1
**Description**: Project initialization: Set up Next.js 14 project with TypeScript support

## Overview
This file contains testing instructions for task T-1.1.1. 
Do NOT begin testing until you have completed all implementation steps in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\active-task.md`.

- Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1`
- Test Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
- Testing Tools: Jest, TypeScript, npm scripts
- Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage

### Acceptance Criteria
### Acceptance Criteria
The following criteria define successful task completion and should be used to verify test coverage:

- Verify all functionality described in the task description
- Ensure all implementation steps are properly tested
- Validate components work correctly in isolation and integration

**Testing Directive**: Ensure your tests explicitly verify each of these acceptance criteria. When creating test cases, map them to specific criteria and check that all criteria are covered by at least one test. After completing all tests, verify and document which tests validate each acceptance criterion.

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
   ```bash
   npm list jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```
   If any are missing, install them:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
   ```

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root:
   ```bash
   [ -f jest.config.js ] && echo "Jest config exists" || echo "Jest config missing"
   ```
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed:
   ```bash
   node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js check-dependency "None"
   ```

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

4. [Coverage Reporting](#coverage-reporting)
5. [Test Result Summary](#test-result-summary)

## Overview
This file contains testing instructions for task T-1.1.1. 
Do NOT begin testing until you have completed all implementation steps in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\active-task.md`.

- Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1`
- Test Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
- Testing Tools: Jest, TypeScript, npm scripts
- Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
   ```bash
   npm list jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```
   If any are missing, install them:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
   ```

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root:
   ```bash
   [ -f jest.config.js ] && echo "Jest config exists" || echo "Jest config missing"
   ```
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed:
   ```bash
   node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js check-dependency "None"
   ```

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

## Test Planning Workpad

As you develop and execute tests for this task, you may use the dedicated test workpad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-work-pad-test.md`

This workpad is your testing sandbox where you can:
- Design complex test cases before formal implementation
- Develop test fixtures and mock data
- Track test failures and debugging steps
- Plan test coverage strategies
- Document edge cases that need testing
- Work through test assertions and expected outcomes
- Track test-specific TODOs as you discover them

Using this workpad is optional but recommended for complex testing scenarios. Nothing written there will be considered final test code - it's purely to assist your testing process.

When using the workpad, consider organizing your entries by element and test case to maintain clarity as you work through the testing requirements.

## Element Tests

## Overview
This file contains testing instructions for task T-1.1.2. 
Do NOT begin testing until you have completed all implementation steps in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\active-task.md`.

- Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1\app`
- Test Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.2\`
- Testing Tools: Jest, TypeScript, fs-extra, path-browserify
- Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
   ```bash
   npm list jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```
   If any are missing, install them:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.2\`
   ```

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root:
   ```bash
   [ -f jest.config.js ] && echo "Jest config exists" || echo "Jest config missing"
   ```
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed:
   ```bash
   node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js check-dependency "T-1.1.1"
   ```

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

## Test Planning Workpad

As you develop and execute tests for this task, you may use the dedicated test workpad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-work-pad-test.md`

This workpad is your testing sandbox where you can:
- Design complex test cases before formal implementation
- Develop test fixtures and mock data
- Track test failures and debugging steps
- Plan test coverage strategies
- Document edge cases that need testing
- Work through test assertions and expected outcomes
- Track test-specific TODOs as you discover them

Using this workpad is optional but recommended for complex testing scenarios. Nothing written there will be considered final test code - it's purely to assist your testing process.

When using the workpad, consider organizing your entries by element and test case to maintain clarity as you work through the testing requirements.

4. [Coverage Reporting](#coverage-reporting)
5. [Test Result Summary](#test-result-summary)

## Overview
This file contains testing instructions for task T-1.1.1. 
Do NOT begin testing until you have completed all implementation steps in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\active-task.md`.

- Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1`
- Test Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
- Testing Tools: Jest, TypeScript, npm scripts
- Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage

### Acceptance Criteria
The following criteria define successful task completion and should be used to verify test coverage:

- Project successfully initialized with Next.js 14 and TypeScript
- Basic App Router structure implemented with expected files and directories
- Project builds without errors using standard Next.js commands
- Essential configuration files properly set up for development

**Testing Directive**: Ensure your tests explicitly verify each of these acceptance criteria. When creating test cases, map them to specific criteria and check that all criteria are covered by at least one test. After completing all tests, verify and document which tests validate each acceptance criterion.

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
   ```bash
   npm list jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```
   If any are missing, install them:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
   ```

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root:
   ```bash
   [ -f jest.config.js ] && echo "Jest config exists" || echo "Jest config missing"
   ```
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed:
   ```bash
   node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js check-dependency "None"
   ```

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

## Test Planning Workpad

As you develop and execute tests for this task, you may use the dedicated test workpad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-work-pad-test.md`

This workpad is your testing sandbox where you can:
- Design complex test cases before formal implementation
- Develop test fixtures and mock data
- Track test failures and debugging steps
- Plan test coverage strategies
- Document edge cases that need testing
- Work through test assertions and expected outcomes
- Track test-specific TODOs as you discover them

      - [T-1.1.1:ELE-1](#t-1.1.1ele-1)
   - [T-1.1.1:ELE-2](#t-1.1.1ele-2)
4. [Coverage Reporting](#coverage-reporting)
5. [Test Result Summary](#test-result-summary)

## Overview
This file contains testing instructions for task T-1.1.1. 
Do NOT begin testing until you have completed all implementation steps in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\active-task.md`.

- Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\aplio-modern-1`
- Test Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
- Testing Tools: Jest, TypeScript, npm scripts
- Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage

### Acceptance Criteria
The following criteria define successful task completion and should be used to verify test coverage:

- Project successfully initialized with Next.js 14 and TypeScript
- Basic App Router structure implemented with expected files and directories
- Project builds without errors using standard Next.js commands
- Essential configuration files properly set up for development

**Testing Directive**: Ensure your tests explicitly verify each of these acceptance criteria. When creating test cases, map them to specific criteria and check that all criteria are covered by at least one test. After completing all tests, verify and document which tests validate each acceptance criterion.

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
   ```bash
   npm list jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```
   If any are missing, install them:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\system\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
   ```

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root:
   ```bash
   [ -f jest.config.js ] && echo "Jest config exists" || echo "Jest config missing"
   ```
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed:
   ```bash
   node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js check-dependency "None"
   ```

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

## Test Planning Workpad

As you develop and execute tests for this task, you may use the dedicated test workpad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-1\aplio-22-cline\pmc\core\task-work-pad-test.md`

This workpad is your testing sandbox where you can:
- Design complex test cases before formal implementation
- Develop test fixtures and mock data
- Track test failures and debugging steps
- Plan test coverage strategies
- Document edge cases that need testing
- Work through test assertions and expected outcomes
- Track test-specific TODOs as you discover them

Using this workpad is optional but recommended for complex testing scenarios. Nothing written there will be considered final test code - it's purely to assist your testing process.

When using the workpad, consider organizing your entries by element and test case to maintain clarity as you work through the testing requirements.

6. [Test Result Summary](#test-result-summary)

## Overview
This file contains testing instructions for task T-1.1.2. 
Do NOT begin testing until you have completed all implementation steps in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\pmc\core\active-task.md`.

- Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\aplio-modern-1\app`
- Test Location: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.2\`
- Testing Tools: Jest, TypeScript, fs-extra, path-browserify
- Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage

### Acceptance Criteria
The following criteria define successful task completion and should be used to verify test coverage:

- App directory structure follows Next.js 14 App Router conventions
- Route groups are properly organized for marketing and authenticated sections
- Directory structure enables efficient navigation between routes
- File naming adheres to Next.js conventions for special files

**Testing Directive**: Ensure your tests explicitly verify each of these acceptance criteria. When creating test cases, map them to specific criteria and check that all criteria are covered by at least one test. After completing all tests, verify and document which tests validate each acceptance criterion.

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
   ```bash
   npm list jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```
   If any are missing, install them:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest typescript ts-jest @types/jest
   ```

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.2\`
   ```

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root:
   ```bash
   [ -f jest.config.js ] && echo "Jest config exists" || echo "Jest config missing"
   ```
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed:
   ```bash
   node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js check-dependency "T-1.1.1"
   ```

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

## Test Planning Workpad

As you develop and execute tests for this task, you may use the dedicated test workpad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\pmc\core\task-work-pad-test.md`

This workpad is your testing sandbox where you can:
- Design complex test cases before formal implementation
- Develop test fixtures and mock data
- Track test failures and debugging steps
- Plan test coverage strategies
- Document edge cases that need testing
- Work through test assertions and expected outcomes
- Track test-specific TODOs as you discover them

Using this workpad is optional but recommended for complex testing scenarios. Nothing written there will be considered final test code - it's purely to assist your testing process.

When using the workpad, consider organizing your entries by element and test case to maintain clarity as you work through the testing requirements.

Do NOT begin testing until you have completed all implementation steps in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\pmc\core\active-task.md`.

- Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\PMC\Aplio-Design-System\aplio-25-a1-c\aplio-modern-1`
- Test Location: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\PMC\Aplio-Design-System\aplio-25-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.1\`
- Testing Tools: Jest, TypeScript, npm scripts
- Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage

### Acceptance Criteria
The following criteria define successful task completion and should be used to verify test coverage:

- Project successfully initialized with Next.js 14 and TypeScript
- Basic App Router structure implemented with expected files and directories
- Project builds without errors using standard Next.js commands
- Essential configuration files properly set up for development

**Testing Directive**: Ensure your tests explicitly verify each of these acceptance criteria. When creating test cases, map them to specific criteria and check that all criteria are covered by at least one test. After completing all tests, verify and document which tests validate each acceptance criterion.

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
 
   If any are missing, install them:

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

## Test Planning Workpad

As you develop and execute tests for this task, you may use the dedicated test workpad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-23-roo\pmc\core\task-work-pad-test.md`

This workpad is your testing sandbox where you can:
- Design complex test cases before formal implementation
- Develop test fixtures and mock data
- Track test failures and debugging steps
- Plan test coverage strategies
- Document edge cases that need testing
- Work through test assertions and expected outcomes
- Track test-specific TODOs as you discover them

Using this workpad is optional but recommended for complex testing scenarios. Nothing written there will be considered final test code - it's purely to assist your testing process.

When using the workpad, consider organizing your entries by element and test case to maintain clarity as you work through the testing requirements.

When creating test cases, map them to specific criteria and check that all criteria are covered by at least one test. After completing all tests, verify and document which tests validate each acceptance criterion.

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
 
   If any are missing, install them:

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

## Test Planning Workpad

As you develop and execute tests for this task, you may use the dedicated test workpad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-test.md`

This workpad is your testing sandbox where you can:
- Design complex test cases before formal implementation
- Develop test fixtures and mock data
- Track test failures and debugging steps
- Plan test coverage strategies
- Document edge cases that need testing
- Work through test assertions and expected outcomes
- Track test-specific TODOs as you discover them

Using this workpad is optional but recommended for complex testing scenarios. Nothing written there will be considered final test code - it's purely to assist your testing process.

When using the workpad, consider organizing your entries by element and test case to maintain clarity as you work through the testing requirements.

# T-1.1.3: T-1.1.3: Server Component Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through validation to ensure T-1.1.3 elements are properly implemented, tested, and functioning according to specifications.

## Testing Strategy Overview
This protocol supports diverse Next.js 14 task types including:
- Visual Component Implementation (UI components, layouts, interactive elements)
- Infrastructure Implementation (loading states, error handling, routing)  
- System Architecture (design systems, utility functions, type definitions)
- API Integration (data fetching, server actions, middleware)

Based on task analysis, this protocol will focus on: Server Component Implementation (non-interactive UI elements with server-side rendering)

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Overview
This file contains testing instructions for task T-1.1.3. 
Do NOT begin testing until you have completed all implementation steps in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\active-task.md`.

- Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
- Test Location: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.3\`
- Testing Tools: Jest, React Testing Library, Next.js Testing Tools, Supertest
- Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage

### Acceptance Criteria
The following criteria define successful task completion and should be used to verify test coverage:

- Non-interactive components are implemented as server components by default
- Client components are explicitly marked with 'use client' directive
- Server/client component composition follows optimal patterns
- Server components render correctly with expected content

**Testing Directive**: Ensure your tests explicitly verify each of these acceptance criteria. When creating test cases, map them to specific criteria and check that all criteria are covered by at least one test. After completing all tests, verify and document which tests validate each acceptance criterion.

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
 
   If any are missing, install them:

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

## Test Planning Workpad

As you develop and execute tests for this task, you may use the dedicated test workpad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-test.md`

This workpad is your testing sandbox where you can:
- Design complex test cases before formal implementation
- Develop test fixtures and mock data
- Track test failures and debugging steps
- Plan test coverage strategies
- Document edge cases that need testing
- Work through test assertions and expected outcomes
- Track test-specific TODOs as you discover them

Using this workpad is optional but recommended for complex testing scenarios. Nothing written there will be considered final test code - it's purely to assist your testing process.

When using the workpad, consider organizing your entries by element and test case to maintain clarity as you work through the testing requirements.

```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify all expected T-1.1.3 component screenshots were successfully captured
# WHEN: Run this after visual testing to confirm all artifacts are ready for LLM Vision analysis
# PREREQUISITES: Visual testing completed, test/screenshots/T-1.1.3/ directory exists
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 2 PNG screenshot files confirmed for T-1.1.3 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If screenshots missing, re-run visual testing for missing components

node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const screenshotDir = 'test/screenshots/T-1.1.3';
const expectedComponents = ['T-1.1.3:ELE-1', 'T-1.1.3:ELE-2'];

if (!fs.existsSync(screenshotDir)) {
  throw new Error('Screenshot directory not found: ' + screenshotDir);
}

const screenshots = fs.readdirSync(screenshotDir).filter(f => f.endsWith('.png'));
console.log('Generated screenshots:', screenshots.length);

let allValid = true;
expectedComponents.forEach(component => {

5. [Coverage Reporting](#coverage-reporting)
6. [Test Result Summary](#test-result-summary)

## Overview
This file contains testing instructions for task T-1.1.4. 
Do NOT begin testing until you have completed all implementation steps in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\active-task.md`.

- Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
- Test Location: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-1\T-1.1.4\`
- Testing Tools: Jest, React Testing Library, MSW (Mock Service Worker), Playwright
- Coverage Requirements: 90% code coverage

### Acceptance Criteria
The following criteria define successful task completion and should be used to verify test coverage:

- Loading states are implemented using loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
- Error handling is implemented at appropriate component boundaries with error.tsx files
- Loading states provide a good user experience during data fetching
- Error states handle various error scenarios gracefully

**Testing Directive**: Ensure your tests explicitly verify each of these acceptance criteria. When creating test cases, map them to specific criteria and check that all criteria are covered by at least one test. After completing all tests, verify and document which tests validate each acceptance criterion.

## Test Environment Setup
Before creating or running tests, ensure your environment is ready:

1. Verify Jest and TypeScript testing tools are installed:
 
   If any are missing, install them:

2. Verify the test directory structure exists for this task

3. Check for a Jest configuration file (`jest.config.js`) in the project root
   
4. Ensure your tests will meet the required coverage target of 90% code coverage

5. Verify that all task dependencies are completed

6. Test Failure Strategy:
   - Document all test failures with error messages and stack traces
   - For each failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
   - Rerun failed tests until they pass
   - If a test cannot be fixed after 3 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality

## Test Planning Workpad

As you develop and execute tests for this task, you may use the dedicated test workpad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-test.md`

This workpad is your testing sandbox where you can:
- Design complex test cases before formal implementation
- Develop test fixtures and mock data
- Track test failures and debugging steps
- Plan test coverage strategies
- Document edge cases that need testing
- Work through test assertions and expected outcomes
- Track test-specific TODOs as you discover them

Using this workpad is optional but recommended for complex testing scenarios. Nothing written there will be considered final test code - it's purely to assist your testing process.

When using the workpad, consider organizing your entries by element and test case to maintain clarity as you work through the testing requirements.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

Task History Entry - 06/02/2025, 10:13:59 PM

# T-1.1.4: UNKNOWN TASK - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

Task History Entry - 06/02/2025, 10:14:11 PM

# T-1.1.5: UNKNOWN TASK - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.5 components (T-1.1.5:ELE-1, T-1.1.5:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

# T-1.1.4: UNKNOWN TASK - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

# T-1.1.4: T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

Task History Entry - 06/02/2025, 10:45:09 PM

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

# T-1.1.5: Layout and Metadata Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.5 components (T-1.1.5:ELE-1, T-1.1.5:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

# T-1.1.5: Layout and Metadata Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.5 components (T-1.1.5:ELE-1, T-1.1.5:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.5 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.5 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.5/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"

### Legacy and Reference Variables
- **test/unit-tests/task-1-1.5/T-1.1.5/**: Path to unit test location
- **## Legacy References

No legacy references found for T-1.1.5 in pmc/product/07b-task-aplio-mod-1-testing-built.md**: Formatted legacy references section
- **- **T-1.1.5:ELE-1 (Server)**: Proper server component with no client directive, Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing, blue boundary
- **T-1.1.5:ELE-2 (Server)**: Proper server component with no client directive, Metadata API: Implement metadata for SEO optimization, blue boundary**: Formatted component requirements from acceptance criteria

### Variable Population Source
All template variables should be populated from:
- **Primary Source**: `pmc/core/active-task.md`
- **Secondary Processing**: Template population system logic for derived values
- **Dynamic Generation**: Script commands and validation steps generated during template processing

### Critical Mapping Requirements
The template population system MUST:
1. Parse the Components/Elements section to extract 2 and {{ELEMENTS_PREVIEW}}
2. Extract and format all Legacy Code References for {{LEGACY_REFERENCES_LIST}}
3. Generate appropriate test commands based on task-specific information
4. Populate all script variables with task-specific paths and requirements
5. Ensure backwards compatibility with existing template variable system

### Example Variable Population (based on current active-task.md T-1.1.5)
```
T-1.1.5 = "T-1.1.5"
Layout and Metadata Implementation = "Layout and Metadata Implementation"
{{TASK_DESCRIPTION}} = "Implement layouts and metadata for optimal code sharing and SEO"
{{TASK_PATTERNS}} = "P013-LAYOUT-COMPONENT"
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` = "C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app"
{{TESTING_TOOLS}} = "Jest, React Testing Library, Lighthouse, Cheerio"
{{TEST_COVERAGE}} = "90% code coverage"
2 = "2"
{{ELEMENTS_PREVIEW}} = "Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing"
{{LEGACY_REFERENCES_LIST}} = "C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30, C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12"
- Root layout provides basic HTML structure for all pages
- Nested layouts optimize code sharing for route groups
- Metadata is implemented for SEO optimization
- Dynamic metadata generation works correctly for various routes = "Root layout provides basic HTML structure for all pages, Nested layouts optimize code sharing for route groups, Metadata is implemented for SEO optimization, Dynamic metadata generation works correctly for various routes"
```

This example shows how the template population system should parse active-task.md to extract task-specific information and populate the enhanced discovery variables for comprehensive testable elements analysis.

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.4 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.4
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Unit Testing

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- All T-1.1.4 components implemented in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`

### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Run Jest Unit Tests for T-1.1.4 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Execute Jest-based unit tests to validate component behavior and compilation
# WHEN: Run this when all T-1.1.4 components have been implemented
# PREREQUISITES: Jest installed, test files exist in test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4/
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All unit tests pass, components compile successfully
# FAILURE HANDLING: If tests fail, analyze errors and apply fix/test/analyze cycle

npm test -- --testPathPattern=task-1-1-4/T-1.1.4 --coverage
```

#### Step 1.2: Validate Server/Client Component Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify proper 'use client' directive usage for client components and absence for server components
# WHEN: Run this after unit tests to ensure correct component classification
# PREREQUISITES: All T-1.1.4 component files exist in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`

### Legacy and Reference Variables
- **test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4/**: Path to unit test location
- **## Legacy References

No legacy references found for T-1.1.4 in pmc/product/07b-task-aplio-mod-1-testing-built.md**: Formatted legacy references section
- **- **T-1.1.4:ELE-1 (Server)**: Proper server component with no client directive, Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries, blue boundary
- **T-1.1.4:ELE-2 (Server)**: Proper server component with no client directive, Error handling: Implement error.tsx files for error handling, blue boundary**: Formatted component requirements from acceptance criteria

### Variable Population Source
All template variables should be populated from:
- **Primary Source**: `pmc/core/active-task.md`
- **Secondary Processing**: Template population system logic for derived values
- **Dynamic Generation**: Script commands and validation steps generated during template processing

### Critical Mapping Requirements
The template population system MUST:
1. Parse the Components/Elements section to extract 2 and {{ELEMENTS_PREVIEW}}
2. Extract and format all Legacy Code References for {{LEGACY_REFERENCES_LIST}}
3. Generate appropriate test commands based on task-specific information
4. Populate all script variables with task-specific paths and requirements
5. Ensure backwards compatibility with existing template variable system

### Example Variable Population (based on current active-task.md T-1.1.5)
```
T-1.1.4 = "T-1.1.5"
Loading and Error States Implementation = "Layout and Metadata Implementation"
{{TASK_DESCRIPTION}} = "Implement layouts and metadata for optimal code sharing and SEO"
{{TASK_PATTERNS}} = "P013-LAYOUT-COMPONENT"
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` = "C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app"
{{TESTING_TOOLS}} = "Jest, React Testing Library, Lighthouse, Cheerio"
{{TEST_COVERAGE}} = "90% code coverage"
2 = "2"
{{ELEMENTS_PREVIEW}} = "Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing"
{{LEGACY_REFERENCES_LIST}} = "C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30, C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12"
- Loading states are implemented using loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
- Error handling is implemented at appropriate component boundaries with error.tsx files
- Loading states provide a good user experience during data fetching
- Error states handle various error scenarios gracefully = "Root layout provides basic HTML structure for all pages, Nested layouts optimize code sharing for route groups, Metadata is implemented for SEO optimization, Dynamic metadata generation works correctly for various routes"
```

This example shows how the template population system should parse active-task.md to extract task-specific information and populate the enhanced discovery variables for comprehensive testable elements analysis.

# T-1.1.5: Layout and Metadata Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.5 components (T-1.1.5:ELE-1, T-1.1.5:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.5 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.5 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.5/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.5 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.5
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: [map legacy references from pmc/product/07b-task-aplio-mod-1-testing-built.md]

### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.5 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.5 - Layout and Metadata Implementation
# - Pattern: {{TASK_PATTERNS}}
# - Description: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`

# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern {{TASK_PATTERNS}}
# 3. Review Legacy References: {{LEGACY_REFERENCES_LIST}}
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions
# - InterfaceName: Type safety and compliance testing requirements
# 
# ### Testing Priority Classification

const { ComponentImporter } = require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/component-importer.js');
const importer = new ComponentImporter();
const T115Components = ['T-1.1.5:ELE-1', 'T-1.1.5:ELE-2'];

async function validateAllComponents() {
  for (const name of T115Components) {
    try {
      await importer.loadComponent(name);

      throw error;
    }
  }
  console.log('All T-1.1.5 components validated');
}

validateAllComponents().catch(console.error);
"
```

#### Step 1.3: Generate Enhanced Scaffolds for All T-1.1.5 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Generate React SSR scaffolds with real rendering, Tailwind CSS, and visual boundaries for all T-1.1.5 components
# WHEN: Run this after component validation to create visual testing artifacts
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffold system available, components successfully imported
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 2 enhanced scaffold HTML files created in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5/ with real React content
# FAILURE HANDLING: If scaffold generation fails, check component props and Enhanced scaffold system

node -e "
const { createEnhancedScaffold } = require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js');
const components = [
  { name: 'T-1.1.5:ELE-1', type: 'server', props: {"title":"Test T-1.1.5:ELE-1 for T-1.1.5","children":"Test content for T-1.1.5:ELE-1 in T-1.1.5"} },
  { name: 'T-1.1.5:ELE-2', type: 'server', props: {"title":"Test T-1.1.5:ELE-2 for T-1.1.5","children":"Test content for T-1.1.5:ELE-2 in T-1.1.5"} }
];

async function generateAllScaffolds() {
  for (const component of components) {
    try {
      const path = await createEnhancedScaffold({ task: 'T-1.1.5', component: component.name, props: component.props });
      console.log('✓', component.name, '(' + component.type + ')', 'scaffold created:', path);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('✗', component.name, 'scaffold failed:', error.message);
      throw error;
    }
  }
  console.log('All T-1.1.5 scaffolds generated');
}

generateAllScaffolds().catch(console.error);
"
```

#### Step 1.4: Validate Scaffold Content Quality
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify scaffolds contain real React content with Tailwind CSS styling and proper component boundaries
# WHEN: Run this after scaffold generation to ensure quality before testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds generated in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5/
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All scaffolds contain real content, Tailwind classes, and visual boundaries
# FAILURE HANDLING: If validation fails, regenerate scaffolds with correct props and styling

# Verify scaffolds contain real content (not mock/placeholder)
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -L "Mock\|placeholder\|test content" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file contains real content"; done

# Verify Tailwind CSS classes are present
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "bg-white\|rounded-lg\|shadow-md\|bg-blue\|bg-green" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has Tailwind CSS"; done

# Check for proper component boundaries
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "Server Component\|Client Component\|component-boundary" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has visual boundaries"; done
```

### Deliverables
- Complete testable elements discovery logged to current-test-approach.md
- 2 enhanced scaffold HTML files in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5/
- Component import validation results
- Real React SSR rendered content ready for testing phases

## Phase 2: Unit Testing

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 1)
- Component discovery and classification complete from Phase 1
- All T-1.1.5 components discovered and validated
- Enhanced scaffolds generated and validated
- Component classifications documented in current-test-approach.md

### Actions

#### Step 2.1: Run Jest Unit Tests for T-1.1.5 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Execute Jest-based unit tests to validate component behavior and compilation
# WHEN: Run this after component discovery to test all discovered components
# PREREQUISITES: Jest installed, test files exist in test/unit-tests/task-1-1.5/T-1.1.5/, components discovered in Phase 1
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All unit tests pass, components compile successfully
# FAILURE HANDLING: If tests fail, analyze errors and apply fix/test/analyze cycle

npm test -- --testPathPattern=task-1-1-5/T-1.1.5 --coverage
```

#### Step 2.2: Validate Server/Client Component Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify proper 'use client' directive usage for client components and absence for server components

# EXPECTED OUTCOME: None have 'use client', None do not
# FAILURE HANDLING: If classification is wrong, add/remove 'use client' directives as needed

# No client components to validate

# No server components to validate
```

#### Step 2.3: Create Unit Test Files for T-1.1.5
```bash
# PURPOSE: Generate comprehensive unit test files for server and client component validation
# WHEN: Run this if unit test files don't exist for discovered T-1.1.5 components
# PREREQUISITES: test/unit-tests/task-1-1.5/T-1.1.5/ directory exists, components discovered in Phase 1
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete test files for server component rendering and client directive validation

```bash
# PURPOSE: Capture pixel-perfect screenshots of all T-1.1.5 components using Playwright
# WHEN: Run this after unit testing and scaffold generation to create visual testing artifacts
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds exist, test server running, Playwright installed
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: High-quality PNG screenshots captured for all 2 T-1.1.5 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If visual testing fails, restart test server and check scaffold accessibility

npm run test:visual:enhanced T-1.1.5
```

#### Step 3.2: Validate Screenshot Generation
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify all expected T-1.1.5 component screenshots were successfully captured
# WHEN: Run this after visual testing to confirm all artifacts are ready for LLM Vision analysis
# PREREQUISITES: Visual testing completed, test/screenshots/T-1.1.5/ directory exists
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 2 PNG screenshot files confirmed for T-1.1.5 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If screenshots missing, re-run visual testing for missing components

node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const screenshotDir = 'test/screenshots/T-1.1.5';
const expectedComponents = ['T-1.1.5:ELE-1', 'T-1.1.5:ELE-2'];

if (!fs.existsSync(screenshotDir)) {
  throw new Error('Screenshot directory not found: ' + screenshotDir);
}

const screenshots = fs.readdirSync(screenshotDir).filter(f => f.endsWith('.png'));
console.log('Generated screenshots:', screenshots.length);

let allValid = true;
expectedComponents.forEach(component => {
  const fileName = component + '-enhanced.png';
  if (screenshots.includes(fileName)) {
    console.log('✓', component, 'screenshot captured');
  } else {
    console.log('✗', component, 'screenshot missing');

  }
});

if (!allValid) {
  throw new Error('Some T-1.1.5 component screenshots are missing');
}
console.log('All T-1.1.5 component screenshots validated');
"
```

#### Step 3.3: Validate Component Boundaries in Screenshots
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify visual boundaries are properly displayed in enhanced scaffolds
# WHEN: Run this after screenshot validation to ensure component classification is visually clear

async function testConnection() {
  try {
    const analyzer = new EnhancedLLMVisionAnalyzer({ verbose: false });
    await analyzer.initialize();
    console.log('✓ Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer API connection successful');
    await analyzer.close();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('✗ Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer connection failed:', error.message);
    throw error;
  }
}
testConnection();
"
```

#### Step 4.2: Execute Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis for All T-1.1.5 Components

# WHEN: Run this after screenshot validation to get comprehensive component analysis
# PREREQUISITES: Screenshots exist, Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer configured, task context available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Detailed analysis reports with 95%+ confidence scores for all components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If analysis fails or confidence low, apply fix/test/analyze cycle
# NOTE: 60-second delay between analyses prevents API rate limiting and ensures reliable processing

COMPONENTS=("T-1.1.5:ELE-1" "T-1.1.5:ELE-2")

for component in "${COMPONENTS[@]}"; do
  echo "Analyzing ${component} component..."
  node test/utils/vision/enhanced-llm-vision-analyzer.js "$component" || echo "RETRY: Analysis failed for ${component}"
  
  # Wait 60 seconds between analyses to prevent API rate limiting

- **- **T-1.1.5:ELE-1 (Server)**: Proper server component with no client directive, Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing, blue boundary
- **T-1.1.5:ELE-2 (Server)**: Proper server component with no client directive, Metadata API: Implement metadata for SEO optimization, blue boundary**: Formatted component requirements from acceptance criteria

### Variable Population Source
All template variables should be populated from:
- **Primary Source**: `pmc/core/active-task.md`
- **Secondary Processing**: Template population system logic for derived values
- **Dynamic Generation**: Script commands and validation steps generated during template processing

### Critical Mapping Requirements
The template population system MUST:
1. Parse the Components/Elements section to extract 2 and {{ELEMENTS_PREVIEW}}
2. Extract and format all Legacy Code References for {{LEGACY_REFERENCES_LIST}}
3. Generate appropriate test commands based on task-specific information
4. Populate all script variables with task-specific paths and requirements
5. Ensure backwards compatibility with existing template variable system

### Example Variable Population (based on current active-task.md T-1.1.5)
```
T-1.1.5 = "T-1.1.5"
Layout and Metadata Implementation = "Layout and Metadata Implementation"
{{TASK_DESCRIPTION}} = "Implement layouts and metadata for optimal code sharing and SEO"
{{TASK_PATTERNS}} = "P013-LAYOUT-COMPONENT"
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` = "C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app"
{{TESTING_TOOLS}} = "Jest, React Testing Library, Lighthouse, Cheerio"
{{TEST_COVERAGE}} = "90% code coverage"
2 = "2"
{{ELEMENTS_PREVIEW}} = "Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing"
{{LEGACY_REFERENCES_LIST}} = "C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30, C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12"
- Root layout provides basic HTML structure for all pages
- Nested layouts optimize code sharing for route groups
- Metadata is implemented for SEO optimization
- Dynamic metadata generation works correctly for various routes = "Root layout provides basic HTML structure for all pages, Nested layouts optimize code sharing for route groups, Metadata is implemented for SEO optimization, Dynamic metadata generation works correctly for various routes"
```

This example shows how the template population system should parse active-task.md to extract task-specific information and populate the enhanced discovery variables for comprehensive testable elements analysis.

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases

### Legacy and Reference Variables
- **test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4/**: Path to unit test location
- **## Legacy References

No legacy references found for T-1.1.4 in pmc/product/07b-task-aplio-mod-1-testing-built.md**: Formatted legacy references section (deprecated - use {{LEGACY_REFERENCES_SECTION}})
- **{{LEGACY_REFERENCES_SECTION}}**: Complete legacy references section formatted from active-task.md
- **- **T-1.1.4:ELE-1 (Server)**: Proper server component with no client directive, Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries, blue boundary
- **T-1.1.4:ELE-2 (Server)**: Proper server component with no client directive, Error handling: Implement error.tsx files for error handling, blue boundary**: Formatted component requirements from acceptance criteria

### Variable Population Source
All template variables should be populated from:
- **Primary Source**: `pmc/core/active-task.md`
- **Secondary Processing**: Template population system logic for derived values
- **Dynamic Generation**: Script commands and validation steps generated during template processing

### Critical Mapping Requirements
The template population system MUST:
1. Parse the Components/Elements section to extract 2 and {{ELEMENTS_PREVIEW}}
2. Extract and format all Legacy Code References for {{LEGACY_REFERENCES_LIST}}
3. Extract all "Refer to Legacy Code Reference:" items from Components/Elements section for {{LEGACY_REFERENCES_SECTION}}
4. Generate appropriate test commands based on task-specific information
5. Populate all script variables with task-specific paths and requirements
6. Ensure backwards compatibility with existing template variable system

### Example Variable Population (based on current active-task.md T-1.1.5)
```
T-1.1.4 = "T-1.1.5"
Loading and Error States Implementation = "Layout and Metadata Implementation"
{{TASK_DESCRIPTION}} = "Implement layouts and metadata for optimal code sharing and SEO"
{{TASK_PATTERNS}} = "P013-LAYOUT-COMPONENT"
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` = "C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app"
{{TESTING_TOOLS}} = "Jest, React Testing Library, Lighthouse, Cheerio"
{{TEST_COVERAGE}} = "90% code coverage"
2 = "2"
{{ELEMENTS_PREVIEW}} = "Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing"
{{LEGACY_REFERENCES_LIST}} = "C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30, C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12"
{{LEGACY_REFERENCES_SECTION}} = "## Legacy Code References

### [T-1.1.5:ELE-1] Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing
Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30` for root layout implementation

### [T-1.1.5:ELE-2] Metadata API: Implement metadata for SEO optimization
Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12` for page metadata"
- Loading states are implemented using loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
- Error handling is implemented at appropriate component boundaries with error.tsx files
- Loading states provide a good user experience during data fetching
- Error states handle various error scenarios gracefully = "Root layout provides basic HTML structure for all pages, Nested layouts optimize code sharing for route groups, Metadata is implemented for SEO optimization, Dynamic metadata generation works correctly for various routes"
```

This example shows how the template population system should parse active-task.md to extract task-specific information and populate the enhanced discovery variables for comprehensive testable elements analysis.

Task History Entry - 06/03/2025, 02:09:35 PM

# T-1.1.5: Layout and Metadata Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.5 components (T-1.1.5:ELE-1, T-1.1.5:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.5 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.5 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.5/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.5 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.5
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: [map legacy references from pmc/product/07b-task-aplio-mod-1-testing-built.md]

### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.5 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.5 - Layout and Metadata Implementation
# - Pattern: {{TASK_PATTERNS}}
# - Description: {{TASK_DESCRIPTION}}
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`

# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern {{TASK_PATTERNS}}
# 3. Review Legacy References: {{LEGACY_REFERENCES_LIST}}
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions
# - InterfaceName: Type safety and compliance testing requirements
# 
# ### Testing Priority Classification
# - High Priority: Critical user-facing elements requiring comprehensive testing
# - Medium Priority: Supporting elements requiring basic validation  
# - Low Priority: Type definitions and simple utilities requiring minimal testing

#### Step 1.2: Discover and Validate T-1.1.5 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Automatically discover and validate that all T-1.1.5 components can be imported and compiled
# WHEN: Run this after testable elements discovery to ensure components are ready for testing and scaffold generation
# PREREQUISITES: Component importer system available, all T-1.1.5 components implemented

```

#### Step 1.3: Generate Enhanced Scaffolds for All T-1.1.5 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Generate React SSR scaffolds with real rendering, Tailwind CSS, and visual boundaries for all T-1.1.5 components
# WHEN: Run this after component validation to create visual testing artifacts
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffold system available, components successfully imported
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 2 enhanced scaffold HTML files created in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5/ with real React content
# FAILURE HANDLING: If scaffold generation fails, check component props and Enhanced scaffold system

node -e "
const { createEnhancedScaffold } = require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js');
const components = [

      throw error;
    }
  }
  console.log('All T-1.1.5 scaffolds generated');
}

generateAllScaffolds().catch(console.error);
"
```

#### Step 1.4: Validate Scaffold Content Quality
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify scaffolds contain real React content with Tailwind CSS styling and proper component boundaries
# WHEN: Run this after scaffold generation to ensure quality before testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds generated in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5/
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All scaffolds contain real content, Tailwind classes, and visual boundaries
# FAILURE HANDLING: If validation fails, regenerate scaffolds with correct props and styling

# Verify scaffolds contain real content (not mock/placeholder)
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -L "Mock\|placeholder\|test content" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file contains real content"; done

# Verify Tailwind CSS classes are present
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "bg-white\|rounded-lg\|shadow-md\|bg-blue\|bg-green" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has Tailwind CSS"; done

# Check for proper component boundaries
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "Server Component\|Client Component\|component-boundary" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has visual boundaries"; done
```

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Variable Population Source
All template variables should be populated from:
- **Primary Source**: `pmc/core/active-task.md`
- **Secondary Processing**: Template population system logic for derived values
- **Dynamic Generation**: Script commands and validation steps generated during template processing

### Critical Mapping Requirements
The template population system MUST:
1. Parse the Components/Elements section to extract 2 and {{ELEMENTS_PREVIEW}}
2. Extract and format all Legacy Code References for {{LEGACY_REFERENCES_LIST}}
3. Extract all "Refer to Legacy Code Reference:" items from Components/Elements section for {{LEGACY_REFERENCES_SECTION}}
4. Generate appropriate test commands based on task-specific information
5. Populate all script variables with task-specific paths and requirements
6. Ensure backwards compatibility with existing template variable system

### Example Variable Population (based on current active-task.md T-1.1.5)
```
T-1.1.4 = "T-1.1.5"
Loading and Error States Implementation = "Layout and Metadata Implementation"
{{TASK_DESCRIPTION}} = "Implement layouts and metadata for optimal code sharing and SEO"
{{TASK_PATTERNS}} = "P013-LAYOUT-COMPONENT"
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` = "C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app"
{{TESTING_TOOLS}} = "Jest, React Testing Library, Lighthouse, Cheerio"
{{TEST_COVERAGE}} = "90% code coverage"
2 = "2"
{{ELEMENTS_PREVIEW}} = "Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing"
{{LEGACY_REFERENCES_LIST}} = "C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30, C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12"
{{LEGACY_REFERENCES_SECTION}} = "## Legacy Code References

### [T-1.1.5:ELE-1] Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing
Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30` for root layout implementation

### [T-1.1.5:ELE-2] Metadata API: Implement metadata for SEO optimization
Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12` for page metadata"
- Loading states are implemented using loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
- Error handling is implemented at appropriate component boundaries with error.tsx files
- Loading states provide a good user experience during data fetching
- Error states handle various error scenarios gracefully = "Root layout provides basic HTML structure for all pages, Nested layouts optimize code sharing for route groups, Metadata is implemented for SEO optimization, Dynamic metadata generation works correctly for various routes"
```

This example shows how the template population system should parse active-task.md to extract task-specific information and populate the enhanced discovery variables for comprehensive testable elements analysis.

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.4 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.4
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: [map legacy references from pmc/product/07b-task-aplio-mod-1-testing-built.md]

### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.4 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.4 - Loading and Error States Implementation
# - Pattern: P025-ERROR-HANDLING
# - Description: Implement loading states with Suspense and error handling at appropriate component boundaries
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P025-ERROR-HANDLING
# 3. Review Legacy References: C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions
# - InterfaceName: Type safety and compliance testing requirements
# 
# ### Testing Priority Classification
# - High Priority: Critical user-facing elements requiring comprehensive testing
# - Medium Priority: Supporting elements requiring basic validation  
# - Low Priority: Type definitions and simple utilities requiring minimal testing

# Verify scaffolds contain real content (not mock/placeholder)
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -L "Mock\|placeholder\|test content" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file contains real content"; done

# Verify Tailwind CSS classes are present
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "bg-white\|rounded-lg\|shadow-md\|bg-blue\|bg-green" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has Tailwind CSS"; done

# Check for proper component boundaries
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "Server Component\|Client Component\|component-boundary" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has visual boundaries"; done

### Variable Population Source
All template variables should be populated from:
- **Primary Source**: `pmc/core/active-task.md`
- **Secondary Processing**: Template population system logic for derived values
- **Dynamic Generation**: Script commands and validation steps generated during template processing

### Critical Mapping Requirements
The template population system MUST:
1. Parse the Components/Elements section to extract 2 and Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
2. Extract and format all Legacy Code References for C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20
3. Extract all "Refer to Legacy Code Reference:" items from Components/Elements section for ## Legacy Code References

Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator
4. Generate appropriate test commands based on task-specific information
5. Populate all script variables with task-specific paths and requirements
6. Ensure backwards compatibility with existing template variable system

### Example Variable Population (based on current active-task.md T-1.1.5)
```
T-1.1.4 = "T-1.1.5"
Loading and Error States Implementation = "Layout and Metadata Implementation"
Implement loading states with Suspense and error handling at appropriate component boundaries = "Implement layouts and metadata for optimal code sharing and SEO"
P025-ERROR-HANDLING = "P013-LAYOUT-COMPONENT"
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` = "C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app"
Jest, React Testing Library, MSW (Mock Service Worker), Playwright = "Jest, React Testing Library, Lighthouse, Cheerio"
90% code coverage = "90% code coverage"
2 = "2"
Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries = "Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing"
C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20 = "C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30, C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12"

Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30` for root layout implementation

### [T-1.1.5:ELE-2] Metadata API: Implement metadata for SEO optimization
Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12` for page metadata"
- Loading states are implemented using loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
- Error handling is implemented at appropriate component boundaries with error.tsx files
- Loading states provide a good user experience during data fetching
- Error states handle various error scenarios gracefully = "Root layout provides basic HTML structure for all pages, Nested layouts optimize code sharing for route groups, Metadata is implemented for SEO optimization, Dynamic metadata generation works correctly for various routes"
```

This example shows how the template population system should parse active-task.md to extract task-specific information and populate the enhanced discovery variables for comprehensive testable elements analysis.

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

      throw error;
    }
  }
  console.log('All T-1.1.4 components validated');
}

validateAllComponents().catch(console.error);
"
```

#### Step 1.3: Generate Enhanced Scaffolds for All T-1.1.4 Components
```bash

# WHEN: Run this after screenshot validation to get comprehensive component analysis
# PREREQUISITES: Screenshots exist, Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer configured, task context available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Detailed analysis reports with 95%+ confidence scores for all components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If analysis fails or confidence low, apply fix/test/analyze cycle
# NOTE: 60-second delay between analyses prevents API rate limiting and ensures reliable processing

COMPONENTS=("T-1.1.4:ELE-1" "T-1.1.4:ELE-2")

for component in "${COMPONENTS[@]}"; do

Task History Entry - 06/03/2025, 02:22:39 PM

# T-1.1.2: App Router Directory Structure Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.2 components (T-1.1.2:ELE-1, T-1.1.2:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again

```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.2 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.2 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.2/T-1.1.2
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.2
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.2
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.2
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash

#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.4 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.4
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: [map legacy references from pmc/product/07b-task-aplio-mod-1-testing-built.md]

### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.4 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.4 - Loading and Error States Implementation
# - Pattern: P025-ERROR-HANDLING
# - Description: Implement loading states with Suspense and error handling at appropriate component boundaries
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: App directory structure: Create the App Router directory structure following Next.js 14 conventions

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: App directory structure: Create the App Router directory structure following Next.js 14 conventions
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P025-ERROR-HANDLING
# 3. Review Legacy References: C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app:1-20
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions
# - InterfaceName: Type safety and compliance testing requirements
# 
# ### Testing Priority Classification
# - High Priority: Critical user-facing elements requiring comprehensive testing
# - Medium Priority: Supporting elements requiring basic validation  
# - Low Priority: Type definitions and simple utilities requiring minimal testing

- **Primary Source**: `pmc/core/active-task.md`
- **Secondary Processing**: Template population system logic for derived values
- **Dynamic Generation**: Script commands and validation steps generated during template processing

### Critical Mapping Requirements
The template population system MUST:
1. Parse the Components/Elements section to extract 2 and App directory structure: Create the App Router directory structure following Next.js 14 conventions
2. Extract and format all Legacy Code References for C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app:1-20
3. Extract all "Refer to Legacy Code Reference:" items from Components/Elements section for ## Legacy Code References

Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app:1-20` for legacy app structure
4. Generate appropriate test commands based on task-specific information
5. Populate all script variables with task-specific paths and requirements
6. Ensure backwards compatibility with existing template variable system

### Example Variable Population (based on current active-task.md T-1.1.5)
```
T-1.1.4 = "T-1.1.5"
Loading and Error States Implementation = "Layout and Metadata Implementation"
Implement loading states with Suspense and error handling at appropriate component boundaries = "Implement layouts and metadata for optimal code sharing and SEO"
P025-ERROR-HANDLING = "P013-LAYOUT-COMPONENT"

Jest, React Testing Library, MSW (Mock Service Worker), Playwright = "Jest, React Testing Library, Lighthouse, Cheerio"
90% code coverage = "90% code coverage"
2 = "2"
App directory structure: Create the App Router directory structure following Next.js 14 conventions = "Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing"
C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app:1-20 = "C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30, C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12"

Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30` for root layout implementation

### [T-1.1.5:ELE-2] Metadata API: Implement metadata for SEO optimization
Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12` for page metadata"
- Loading states are implemented using loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
- Error handling is implemented at appropriate component boundaries with error.tsx files
- Loading states provide a good user experience during data fetching
- Error states handle various error scenarios gracefully = "Root layout provides basic HTML structure for all pages, Nested layouts optimize code sharing for route groups, Metadata is implemented for SEO optimization, Dynamic metadata generation works correctly for various routes"
```

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

# WHEN: Run this after screenshot validation to get comprehensive component analysis
# PREREQUISITES: Screenshots exist, Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer configured, task context available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Detailed analysis reports with 95%+ confidence scores for all components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If analysis fails or confidence low, apply fix/test/analyze cycle
# NOTE: 60-second delay between analyses prevents API rate limiting and ensures reliable processing

COMPONENTS=("T-1.1.4:ELE-1" "T-1.1.4:ELE-2")

for component in "${COMPONENTS[@]}"; do

Task History Entry - 06/03/2025, 02:35:07 PM

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.4 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.4
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.4 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.4 - Loading and Error States Implementation
# - Pattern: P025-ERROR-HANDLING
# - Description: Implement loading states with Suspense and error handling at appropriate component boundaries
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P025-ERROR-HANDLING
# 3. Review Legacy References: Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions
# - InterfaceName: Type safety and compliance testing requirements
# 
# ### Testing Priority Classification

# Verify scaffolds contain real content (not mock/placeholder)
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -L "Mock\|placeholder\|test content" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file contains real content"; done

# Verify Tailwind CSS classes are present
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "bg-white\|rounded-lg\|shadow-md\|bg-blue\|bg-green" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has Tailwind CSS"; done

# Check for proper component boundaries
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "Server Component\|Client Component\|component-boundary" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has visual boundaries"; done

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.4 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.4
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator
Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.4 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.4 - Loading and Error States Implementation
# - Pattern: P025-ERROR-HANDLING

# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.4 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.4

- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator
Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.4 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.4 - Loading and Error States Implementation
# - Pattern: P025-ERROR-HANDLING
# - Description: Implement loading states with Suspense and error handling at appropriate component boundaries
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P025-ERROR-HANDLING

Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
#

#### Step 1.2: Discover and Validate T-1.1.4 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Automatically discover and validate that all T-1.1.4 components can be imported and compiled
# WHEN: Run this after testable elements discovery to ensure components are ready for testing and scaffold generation
# PREREQUISITES: Component importer system available, all T-1.1.4 components implemented
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All 2 T-1.1.4 components successfully imported and validated
# FAILURE HANDLING: If component import fails, check file paths and TypeScript compilation errors

node -e "
const { ComponentImporter } = require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/component-importer.js');
const importer = new ComponentImporter();
const T114Components = ['T-1.1.4:ELE-1', 'T-1.1.4:ELE-2'];

async function validateAllComponents() {
  for (const name of T114Components) {
    try {
      await importer.loadComponent(name);
      console.log('✓', name, 'imported successfully');
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('✗', name, 'failed:', error.message);
      throw error;
    }
  }
  console.log('All T-1.1.4 components validated');
}

validateAllComponents().catch(console.error);
"
```

#### Step 1.3: Generate Enhanced Scaffolds for All T-1.1.4 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Generate React SSR scaffolds with real rendering, Tailwind CSS, and visual boundaries for all T-1.1.4 components
# WHEN: Run this after component validation to create visual testing artifacts
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffold system available, components successfully imported
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 2 enhanced scaffold HTML files created in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4/ with real React content
# FAILURE HANDLING: If scaffold generation fails, check component props and Enhanced scaffold system

node -e "
const { createEnhancedScaffold } = require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js');
const components = [
  { name: 'T-1.1.4:ELE-1', type: 'server', props: {"title":"Test T-1.1.4:ELE-1 for T-1.1.4","children":"Test content for T-1.1.4:ELE-1 in T-1.1.4"} },
  { name: 'T-1.1.4:ELE-2', type: 'server', props: {"title":"Test T-1.1.4:ELE-2 for T-1.1.4","children":"Test content for T-1.1.4:ELE-2 in T-1.1.4"} }
];

async function generateAllScaffolds() {
  for (const component of components) {
    try {
      const path = await createEnhancedScaffold({ task: 'T-1.1.4', component: component.name, props: component.props });
      console.log('✓', component.name, '(' + component.type + ')', 'scaffold created:', path);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('✗', component.name, 'scaffold failed:', error.message);
      throw error;
    }
  }
  console.log('All T-1.1.4 scaffolds generated');
}

generateAllScaffolds().catch(console.error);
"
```

#### Step 1.4: Validate Scaffold Content Quality
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify scaffolds contain real React content with Tailwind CSS styling and proper component boundaries
# WHEN: Run this after scaffold generation to ensure quality before testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds generated in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4/
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All scaffolds contain real content, Tailwind classes, and visual boundaries
# FAILURE HANDLING: If validation fails, regenerate scaffolds with correct props and styling

# Verify scaffolds contain real content (not mock/placeholder)
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -L "Mock\|placeholder\|test content" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file contains real content"; done

# Verify Tailwind CSS classes are present
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "bg-white\|rounded-lg\|shadow-md\|bg-blue\|bg-green" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has Tailwind CSS"; done

# Check for proper component boundaries
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "Server Component\|Client Component\|component-boundary" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has visual boundaries"; done
```

### Validation

- [ ] Components successfully imported and validated
- [ ] Enhanced scaffolds generated for all components
- [ ] Scaffolds contain real React content (not mock HTML)
- [ ] Tailwind CSS styling applied correctly
- [ ] Visual boundaries present (blue for server, green for client)

### Deliverables
- Complete testable elements discovery logged to current-test-approach.md
- 2 enhanced scaffold HTML files in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4/
- Component import validation results
- Real React SSR rendered content ready for testing phases

## Phase 2: Unit Testing

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 1)
- Component discovery and classification complete from Phase 1
- All T-1.1.4 components discovered and validated
- Enhanced scaffolds generated and validated
- Component classifications documented in current-test-approach.md

### Actions

#### Step 2.1: Run Jest Unit Tests for T-1.1.4 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Execute Jest-based unit tests to validate component behavior and compilation
# WHEN: Run this after component discovery to test all discovered components
# PREREQUISITES: Jest installed, test files exist in test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4/, components discovered in Phase 1
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All unit tests pass, components compile successfully
# FAILURE HANDLING: If tests fail, analyze errors and apply fix/test/analyze cycle

npm test -- --testPathPattern=task-1-1-4/T-1.1.4 --coverage
```

#### Step 2.2: Validate Server/Client Component Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify proper 'use client' directive usage for client components and absence for server components
# WHEN: Run this after component discovery to validate discovered component classifications
# PREREQUISITES: All T-1.1.4 component files discovered in Phase 1, components exist in `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: None have 'use client', None do not
# FAILURE HANDLING: If classification is wrong, add/remove 'use client' directives as needed

# No client components to validate

# No server components to validate
```

#### Step 2.3: Create Unit Test Files for T-1.1.4
```bash
# PURPOSE: Generate comprehensive unit test files for server and client component validation
# WHEN: Run this if unit test files don't exist for discovered T-1.1.4 components
# PREREQUISITES: test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4/ directory exists, components discovered in Phase 1
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete test files for server component rendering and client directive validation
# FAILURE HANDLING: If file creation fails, check directory permissions and path accuracy


```

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

# T-1.1.3: Server Component Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.3 components (T-1.1.3:ELE-1, T-1.1.3:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with server/client classification.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.3 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.3 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.3/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.3 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.3 - Server Component Implementation
# - Pattern: P002-SERVER-COMPONENT
# - Description: Implement server components for non-interactive parts of the application
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P002-SERVER-COMPONENT
# 3. Review Legacy References: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions
# - InterfaceName: Type safety and compliance testing requirements
# 
# ### Testing Priority Classification
# - High Priority: Critical user-facing elements requiring comprehensive testing
# - Medium Priority: Supporting elements requiring basic validation  
# - Low Priority: Type definitions and simple utilities requiring minimal testing

# WHEN: Run this after scaffold generation to ensure quality before testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds generated in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3/
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All scaffolds contain real content, Tailwind classes, and visual boundaries
# FAILURE HANDLING: If validation fails, regenerate scaffolds with correct props and styling

# Verify scaffolds contain real content (not mock/placeholder)
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -L "Mock\|placeholder\|test content" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file contains real content"; done

# Verify Tailwind CSS classes are present
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "bg-white\|rounded-lg\|shadow-md\|bg-blue\|bg-green" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has Tailwind CSS"; done

# Check for proper component boundaries
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "Server Component\|Client Component\|component-boundary" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has visual boundaries"; done

#### Step 5.2: Generate Human-Readable Testing Report
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create final testing report for human validation with all T-1.1.3 results and artifacts
# WHEN: Run this as the final step to provide complete testing documentation
# PREREQUISITES: Testing summary compiled, all artifacts confirmed
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Comprehensive testing report saved for human review
# FAILURE HANDLING: If report generation fails, check file permissions and artifact availability

cat > test/reports/T-1.1.3-testing-report.md << 'EOF'
# T-1.1.3 undefined - Testing Report

## Executive Summary
Complete testing validation for T-1.1.3 components with Enhanced LLM Vision analysis.

- Non-interactive components are implemented as server components by default
- Client components are explicitly marked with 'use client' directive
- Server/client component composition follows optimal patterns
- Server components render correctly with expected content = "Root layout provides basic HTML structure for all pages, Nested layouts optimize code sharing for route groups, Metadata is implemented for SEO optimization, Dynamic metadata generation works correctly for various routes"
```

This example shows how the template population system should parse active-task.md to extract task-specific information and populate the enhanced discovery variables for comprehensive testable elements analysis.

# T-1.1.3: Server Component Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.3 components (T-1.1.3:ELE-1, T-1.1.3:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with server/client classification.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.3 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.3 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.3/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.3 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.3
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.3 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.3 - Server Component Implementation
# - Pattern: P002-SERVER-COMPONENT
# - Description: Implement server components for non-interactive parts of the application
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P002-SERVER-COMPONENT
# 3. Review Legacy References: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions

#### Step 1.2: Discover and Validate T-1.1.3 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Automatically discover and validate that all T-1.1.3 components can be imported and compiled
# WHEN: Run this after testable elements discovery to ensure components are ready for testing and scaffold generation
# PREREQUISITES: Component importer system available, all T-1.1.3 components implemented
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All 2 T-1.1.3 components successfully imported and validated
# FAILURE HANDLING: If component import fails, check file paths and TypeScript compilation errors

node -e "
const { ComponentImporter } = require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/component-importer.js');

      throw error;
    }
  }
  console.log('All T-1.1.3 components validated');
}

validateAllComponents().catch(console.error);
"
```

#### Step 1.3: Generate Enhanced Scaffolds for All T-1.1.3 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Generate React SSR scaffolds with real rendering, Tailwind CSS, and visual boundaries for all T-1.1.3 components
# WHEN: Run this after component validation to create visual testing artifacts
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffold system available, components successfully imported
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 2 enhanced scaffold HTML files created in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3/ with real React content
# FAILURE HANDLING: If scaffold generation fails, check component props and Enhanced scaffold system

node -e "
const { createEnhancedScaffold } = require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js');
const components = [
  { name: 'T-1.1.3:ELE-1', type: 'server', props: {"title":"Test T-1.1.3:ELE-1 for T-1.1.3","children":"Test content for T-1.1.3:ELE-1 in T-1.1.3"} },
  { name: 'T-1.1.3:ELE-2', type: 'client', props: {"title":"Test T-1.1.3:ELE-2 for T-1.1.3","children":"Test content for T-1.1.3:ELE-2 in T-1.1.3"} }

      throw error;
    }
  }
  console.log('All T-1.1.3 scaffolds generated');
}

generateAllScaffolds().catch(console.error);
"
```

#### Step 1.4: Validate Scaffold Content Quality
```bash

# WHEN: Run this after scaffold generation to ensure quality before testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds generated in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3/
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All scaffolds contain real content, Tailwind classes, and visual boundaries
# FAILURE HANDLING: If validation fails, regenerate scaffolds with correct props and styling

# Verify scaffolds contain real content (not mock/placeholder)
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -L "Mock\|placeholder\|test content" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file contains real content"; done

# Verify Tailwind CSS classes are present
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "bg-white\|rounded-lg\|shadow-md\|bg-blue\|bg-green" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has Tailwind CSS"; done

# Check for proper component boundaries
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "Server Component\|Client Component\|component-boundary" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has visual boundaries"; done

#### Step 4.2: Execute Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis for All T-1.1.3 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Run Enhanced LLM Vision analysis on each T-1.1.3 component to validate content and classification
# WHEN: Run this after screenshot validation to get comprehensive component analysis
# PREREQUISITES: Screenshots exist, Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer configured, task context available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Detailed analysis reports with 95%+ confidence scores for all components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If analysis fails or confidence low, apply fix/test/analyze cycle
# NOTE: 60-second delay between analyses prevents API rate limiting and ensures reliable processing

COMPONENTS=("T-1.1.3:ELE-1" "T-1.1.3:ELE-2")

for component in "${COMPONENTS[@]}"; do
  echo "Analyzing ${component} component..."
  node test/utils/vision/enhanced-llm-vision-analyzer.js "$component" || echo "RETRY: Analysis failed for ${component}"
  
  # Wait 60 seconds between analyses to prevent API rate limiting
  if [ "$component" != "T-1.1.3:ELE-2" ]; then
    echo "⏱️ Waiting 60 seconds before next analysis to prevent rate limiting..."
    sleep 60
  fi
done
```

#### Step 4.3: Validate LLM Vision Analysis Results
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify all T-1.1.3 components have comprehensive analysis reports with acceptable confidence scores
# WHEN: Run this after component analysis to ensure all deliverables are complete

# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 2 detailed analysis reports confirmed in test/screenshots/T-1.1.3/
# FAILURE HANDLING: If reports missing or confidence low, re-run analysis with improved prompts

COMPONENTS=("T-1.1.3:ELE-1" "T-1.1.3:ELE-2")

for component in "${COMPONENTS[@]}"; do
  report_path="test/screenshots/T-1.1.3/${component}-enhanced-analysis.md"

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

# T-1.1.5: Layout and Metadata Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.5 components (T-1.1.5:ELE-1, T-1.1.5:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.5 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.5 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.5/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.5
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript

# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.5 - Layout and Metadata Implementation
# - Pattern: P013-LAYOUT-COMPONENT
# - Description: Implement layouts and metadata for optimal code sharing and SEO
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P013-LAYOUT-COMPONENT

#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.4 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.4 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.4/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.4
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.4 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.4
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30` for root layout implementation
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12` for page metadata


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.4 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.4 - Loading and Error States Implementation
# - Pattern: P025-ERROR-HANDLING
# - Description: Implement loading states with Suspense and error handling at appropriate component boundaries
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P025-ERROR-HANDLING
# 3. Review Legacy References: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30` for root layout implementation
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12` for page metadata
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery

# T-1.1.3: Server Component Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.3 components (T-1.1.3:ELE-1, T-1.1.3:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with server/client classification.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.3 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.3 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.3/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.3 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.3
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.3 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.3 - Server Component Implementation
# - Pattern: P002-SERVER-COMPONENT
# - Description: Implement server components for non-interactive parts of the application
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P002-SERVER-COMPONENT
# 3. Review Legacy References: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions
# - InterfaceName: Type safety and compliance testing requirements
# 
# ### Testing Priority Classification

#### Step 1.2: Discover and Validate T-1.1.3 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Automatically discover and validate that all T-1.1.3 components can be imported and compiled
# WHEN: Run this after testable elements discovery to ensure components are ready for testing and scaffold generation
# PREREQUISITES: Component importer system available, all T-1.1.3 components implemented
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All 2 T-1.1.3 components successfully imported and validated
# FAILURE HANDLING: If component import fails, check file paths and TypeScript compilation errors

node -e "
const { ComponentImporter } = require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/component-importer.js');
const importer = new ComponentImporter();
const T113Components = ['T-1.1.3:ELE-1', 'T-1.1.3:ELE-2'];

async function validateAllComponents() {
  for (const name of T113Components) {

      await importer.loadComponent(name);
      console.log('✓', name, 'imported successfully');
    } catch (error) {

      throw error;
    }
  }
  console.log('All T-1.1.3 components validated');
}

validateAllComponents().catch(console.error);
"
```

#### Step 1.3: Generate Enhanced Scaffolds for All T-1.1.3 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Generate React SSR scaffolds with real rendering, Tailwind CSS, and visual boundaries for all T-1.1.3 components
# WHEN: Run this after component validation to create visual testing artifacts
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffold system available, components successfully imported
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 2 enhanced scaffold HTML files created in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3/ with real React content
# FAILURE HANDLING: If scaffold generation fails, check component props and Enhanced scaffold system

node -e "
const { createEnhancedScaffold } = require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js');
const components = [
  { name: 'T-1.1.3:ELE-1', type: 'server', props: {"title":"Test T-1.1.3:ELE-1 for T-1.1.3","children":"Test content for T-1.1.3:ELE-1 in T-1.1.3"} },
  { name: 'T-1.1.3:ELE-2', type: 'client', props: {"title":"Test T-1.1.3:ELE-2 for T-1.1.3","children":"Test content for T-1.1.3:ELE-2 in T-1.1.3"} }
];

async function generateAllScaffolds() {

      throw error;
    }
  }
  console.log('All T-1.1.3 scaffolds generated');
}

generateAllScaffolds().catch(console.error);
"
```

#### Step 1.4: Validate Scaffold Content Quality
```bash
# PURPOSE: Verify scaffolds contain real React content with Tailwind CSS styling and proper component boundaries
# WHEN: Run this after scaffold generation to ensure quality before testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffolds generated in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3/
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All scaffolds contain real content, Tailwind classes, and visual boundaries
# FAILURE HANDLING: If validation fails, regenerate scaffolds with correct props and styling

# Verify scaffolds contain real content (not mock/placeholder)
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -L "Mock\|placeholder\|test content" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file contains real content"; done

# Verify Tailwind CSS classes are present
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "bg-white\|rounded-lg\|shadow-md\|bg-blue\|bg-green" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has Tailwind CSS"; done

# Check for proper component boundaries
find test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3 -name "*-enhanced.html" -exec grep -l "Server Component\|Client Component\|component-boundary" {} \; | while read file; do echo "✓ $file has visual boundaries"; done
```

# EXPECTED OUTCOME: T-1.1.3:ELE-1, T-1.1.3:ELE-2 have 'use client', T-1.1.3:ELE-1 do not
# FAILURE HANDLING: If classification is wrong, add/remove 'use client' directives as needed

# Check client components have 'use client' directive
grep -l "use client" `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`/T-1.1.3:ELE-1.tsx `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`/T-1.1.3:ELE-2.tsx

# T-1.1.3: Server Component Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.3 components (T-1.1.3:ELE-1, T-1.1.3:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with server/client classification.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.3 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.3 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.3/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.3 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.3
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.3 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.3 - Server Component Implementation
# - Pattern: P002-SERVER-COMPONENT
# - Description: Implement server components for non-interactive parts of the application
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P002-SERVER-COMPONENT
# 3. Review Legacy References: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions
# - InterfaceName: Type safety and compliance testing requirements
# 
# ### Testing Priority Classification
# - High Priority: Critical user-facing elements requiring comprehensive testing
# - Medium Priority: Supporting elements requiring basic validation  
# - Low Priority: Type definitions and simple utilities requiring minimal testing

# T-1.1.2: App Router Directory Structure Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.2 components (T-1.1.2:ELE-1, T-1.1.2:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.2 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.2 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.2/T-1.1.2
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.2
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.2
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.2
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.2 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.2
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.2 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.2 - App Router Directory Structure Implementation
# - Pattern: P001-APP-STRUCTURE
# - Description: Implement the App Router directory structure with route groups and essential page files
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P001-APP-STRUCTURE
# 3. Review Legacy References: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling

# T-1.1.3: Server Component Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.3 components (T-1.1.3:ELE-1, T-1.1.3:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with server/client classification.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.3 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.3 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.3/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.3 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables
- Complete test directory structure for T-1.1.3
- Running test server and dashboard
- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app:1-20` for legacy app structure
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:1-5` for page structure


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.3 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.3 - Server Component Implementation
# - Pattern: P002-SERVER-COMPONENT
# - Description: Implement server components for non-interactive parts of the application
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: App directory structure: Create the App Router directory structure following Next.js 14 conventions

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: App directory structure: Create the App Router directory structure following Next.js 14 conventions
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P002-SERVER-COMPONENT
# 3. Review Legacy References: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app:1-20` for legacy app structure
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:1-5` for page structure
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions
# - InterfaceName: Type safety and compliance testing requirements
# 
# ### Testing Priority Classification
# - High Priority: Critical user-facing elements requiring comprehensive testing
# - Medium Priority: Supporting elements requiring basic validation  
# - Low Priority: Type definitions and simple utilities requiring minimal testing

# T-1.1.3: Server Component Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.3 components (T-1.1.3:ELE-1, T-1.1.3:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with server/client classification.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.3 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.3 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.3/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

- Verified testing environment ready for Phase 1

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.3 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.3 - Server Component Implementation
# - Pattern: P002-SERVER-COMPONENT
# - Description: Implement server components for non-interactive parts of the application
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P002-SERVER-COMPONENT
# 3. Review Legacy References: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions
# - InterfaceName: Type safety and compliance testing requirements
# 
# ### Testing Priority Classification

# T-1.1.3: Server Component Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.3 components (T-1.1.3:ELE-1, T-1.1.3:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with server/client classification.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.1.3 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.1.3 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-1.3/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.1.3
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.1.3 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables

## Phase 1: Component Discovery & Classification

### Prerequisites (builds on Phase 0)
- Test environment setup complete from Phase 0
- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:6-15` for page component implementation
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.3 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.3 - Server Component Implementation
# - Pattern: P002-SERVER-COMPONENT
# - Description: Implement server components for non-interactive parts of the application
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Server component implementation: Create server components as default for non-interactive parts
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P002-SERVER-COMPONENT

`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-10` for interactive component implementation
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions

      throw error;
    }
  }
  console.log('All T-1.1.3 components validated');
}

validateAllComponents().catch(console.error);
"
```

#### Step 1.3: Generate Enhanced Scaffolds for All T-1.1.3 Components
```bash
# PURPOSE: Generate React SSR scaffolds with real rendering, Tailwind CSS, and visual boundaries for all T-1.1.3 components
# WHEN: Run this after component validation to create visual testing artifacts
# DOCUMENTATION: You MUST read all of C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\system\plans\task-approach\current-test-approach.md because all testable elements have been documented there.
# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffold system available, components successfully imported
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 2 enhanced scaffold HTML files created in test/scaffolds/T-1.1.3/ with real React content
# FAILURE HANDLING: If scaffold generation fails, check component props and Enhanced scaffold system

node -e "
const { createEnhancedScaffold } = require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js');
const components = [
  { name: 'T-1.1.3:ELE-1', type: 'server', props: {"title":"Test T-1.1.3:ELE-1 for T-1.1.3","children":"Test content for T-1.1.3:ELE-1 in T-1.1.3"} },

# T-1.1.4: Loading and Error States Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.4 components (T-1.1.4:ELE-1, T-1.1.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

# T-1.1.5: Layout and Metadata Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.1.5 components (T-1.1.5:ELE-1, T-1.1.5:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.1.5 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-approach.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.1.5 - Layout and Metadata Implementation
# - Pattern: P013-LAYOUT-COMPONENT
# - Description: Implement layouts and metadata for optimal code sharing and SEO
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Loading states: Implement loading.tsx files and Suspense boundaries
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\app` with pattern P013-LAYOUT-COMPONENT
# 3. Review Legacy References: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\LoadingSpinner.jsx:1-20` for loading indicator
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\ErrorDisplay.jsx:1-25` for error display implementation
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-approach.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling

# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-approach.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus

# T-1.2.1: TypeScript Configuration Setup - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.2.1 components (T-1.2.1:ELE-1, T-1.2.1:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

#### Step 0.1: Navigate to Application Directory
```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.2.1 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.2.1 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-2.1/T-1.2.1
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.2.1
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.2.1
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.2.1
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.2.1 test directories created
- [ ] Test server running on port 3333
- [ ] Dashboard running on port 3334
- [ ] All testing dependencies installed

### Deliverables

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-discovery.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\layout.jsx:1-30` for root layout implementation
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:8-12` for page metadata


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification

# - Pattern: P004-TYPESCRIPT-SETUP
# - Description: Set up TypeScript configuration with strict mode enabled
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1` with pattern P004-TYPESCRIPT-SETUP

#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-discovery.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions

# T-1.2.2: Component Type Definitions - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.2.2 components (T-1.2.2:ELE-1, T-1.2.2:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.2.2 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.2.2 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-2.2/T-1.2.2
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.2.2
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.2.2
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.2.2

# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

# T-1.2.3: API and Utility Type Definitions - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.2.3 components (T-1.2.3:ELE-1, T-1.2.3:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- You are in the project root directory
- You have npm and Node.js installed
- Git bash or equivalent terminal access

### Actions

```bash
# PURPOSE: Navigate from pmc directory to aplio-modern-1 application directory where testing infrastructure exists
# WHEN: Execute this as the first step before any testing operations
# PREREQUISITES: You are currently in pmc directory (default shell location)
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: You will be in aplio-modern-1/ directory with access to test/ subdirectory
# FAILURE HANDLING: If directory doesn't exist, verify you're in the correct project structure

cd ..
cd aplio-modern-1
```

#### Step 0.2: Create Test Directory Structure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Create the complete directory structure required for T-1.2.3 testing artifacts
# WHEN: Run this before any testing phases to ensure all output directories exist
# PREREQUISITES: You are in aplio-modern-1/ directory
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All required test directories exist for T-1.2.3 components
# FAILURE HANDLING: If mkdir fails, check permissions and available disk space

mkdir -p test/unit-tests/task-1-2.3/T-1.2.3
mkdir -p test/screenshots/T-1.2.3
mkdir -p test/scaffolds/T-1.2.3
mkdir -p test/references/T-1.2.3
mkdir -p test/diffs
mkdir -p test/reports
mkdir -p test/vision-results
```

#### Step 0.3: Start Testing Infrastructure
```bash
# PURPOSE: Start enhanced test server and dashboard for React SSR and visual testing
# WHEN: Run this after directory creation and keep running during all testing phases
# PREREQUISITES: npm packages installed, ports 3333 and 3334 available
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Test server running on port 3333, dashboard on port 3334
# FAILURE HANDLING: If server fails to start, check port availability and npm dependencies

# Terminal 1: Start enhanced test server
npm run test:server:enhanced

# Wait for server startup, then verify
sleep 5
curl -s http://localhost:3333/status || echo "RETRY: npm run test:server:enhanced"

# Terminal 2: Start enhanced dashboard  
npm run test:dashboard:enhanced

# Wait for dashboard startup, then verify
sleep 3
curl -s http://localhost:3334 > /dev/null || echo "RETRY: npm run test:dashboard:enhanced"
```

#### Step 0.4: Verify System Dependencies
```bash
# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

### Validation
- [ ] aplio-modern-1/ directory accessed
- [ ] All T-1.2.3 test directories created

- Test server and dashboard running
- Enhanced scaffold system verified in Phase 0

### Discovery Requirements:
- Find ALL testable elements mentioned in the Components/Elements section
- Name and describe each element discovered. Include the full path to it's implemented location and log those data points this file: pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-discovery.md  
- Prioritize elements based on user impact and complexity
- Consider legacy references: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\home-4\Hero.jsx:5-15` for component props
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:5-10` for component state


### Actions

#### Step 1.1: Enhanced Testable Elements Discovery and Classification
```bash
# PURPOSE: Discover all testable elements created by T-1.2.3 and classify their testing approach using AI-powered analysis
# WHEN: Execute this after environment setup to understand what needs to be tested comprehensively
# PREREQUISITES: Task requirements reviewed, active-task.md available, AI discovery system configured
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Complete analysis of all testable elements logged to current-test-discovery.md with classifications
# FAILURE HANDLING: If discovery fails, review task requirements and legacy references for clarity, retry with improved prompts

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.2.3 - API and Utility Type Definitions
# - Pattern: P005-COMPONENT-TYPES
# - Description: Create type definitions for API requests/responses and utility functions
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\types`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Component prop types: Define interfaces or type aliases for component props

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Component prop types: Define interfaces or type aliases for component props
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\types` with pattern P005-COMPONENT-TYPES
# 3. Review Legacy References: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\home-4\Hero.jsx:5-15` for component props
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:5-10` for component state
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-discovery.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-discovery.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions

# PREREQUISITES: Enhanced scaffold system available, components successfully imported
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: 2 enhanced scaffold HTML files created in test/scaffolds/T-1.2.3/ with real React content
# FAILURE HANDLING: If scaffold generation fails, check component props and Enhanced scaffold system

node -e "
const { createEnhancedScaffold } = require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js');
const components = [
  { name: 'T-1.2.3:ELE-1', type: 'server', props: {"title":"Test T-1.2.3:ELE-1 for T-1.2.3","children":"Test content for T-1.2.3:ELE-1 in T-1.2.3"} },

# T-1.2.4: Event and External Library Type Integration - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.2.4 components (T-1.2.4:ELE-1, T-1.2.4:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

# PURPOSE: Ensure all required testing tools and dependencies are installed and functional
# WHEN: Run this after server startup to validate complete testing environment
# PREREQUISITES: npm is available, internet connection for package installation
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: Jest, Playwright, TypeScript, Enhanced scaffold system, and LLM Vision dependencies confirmed
# FAILURE HANDLING: Install missing packages as indicated by each check

npm list jest > /dev/null || npm install --save-dev jest
npx playwright --version > /dev/null || npx playwright install
npm list axios > /dev/null || npm install axios
node -e "require('ts-node')" || npm install --save-dev ts-node typescript
node -e "require('./test/utils/scaffold-templates/create-enhanced-scaffold.js')" || echo "CRITICAL: Enhanced scaffold system missing"
```

# PURPOSE: Execute Jest-based unit tests to validate component behavior and compilation
# WHEN: Run this after component discovery to test all discovered components
# DOCUMENTATION: You MUST read all of C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\system\plans\task-approach\current-test-discovery.md because all testable elements have been documented there.
# PREREQUISITES: Jest installed, test files exist in test/unit-tests/task-1-2.4/T-1.2.4/, components discovered in Phase 1
# EXPECTED OUTCOME: All unit tests pass, components compile successfully
# FAILURE HANDLING: If tests fail, analyze errors and apply fix/test/analyze cycle

npm test -- --testPathPattern=task-1-2-4/T-1.2.4 --coverage
```

#### Step 2.2: Validate Server/Client Component Classification

# T-1.3.1: Component Directory Structure Setup - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.3.1 components (T-1.3.1:ELE-1, T-1.3.1:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with component functionality.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

# T-1.3.2: Server/Client Component Pattern Implementation - Enhanced Testing Protocol

## Mission Statement
Execute complete testing cycle from environment setup through visual validation with LLM Vision analysis to ensure T-1.3.2 components (T-1.3.2:ELE-1, T-1.3.2:ELE-2) are properly implemented, styled, and functioning with server/client classification.

## Fix/Test/Analyze Cycle Pattern
For any failed validation step in ANY phase:
1. **Log Issue**: Document failure details and error messages
2. **Attempt Fix**: Apply automated correction if possible  
3. **Re-run Test**: Execute the failed step again
4. **Evaluate Results**: Check if issue is resolved
5. **Update Artifacts**: Regenerate affected files (scaffolds, screenshots, reports)
6. **Repeat**: Continue until success or maximum iterations reached (default: 3 attempts)

## Phase 0: Pre-Testing Environment Setup

# Enhanced Testable Components Discovery
# Task-Specific Context Analysis:
# - Task: T-1.3.2 - Server/Client Component Pattern Implementation
# - Pattern: P002-SERVER-COMPONENT, P003-CLIENT-COMPONENT
# - Description: Implement server/client component patterns and optimize boundaries
# - Implementation Location: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\components`
# - Elements to Analyze: 2 elements
# - Element Preview: Component organization: Set up directory structure for components

# Targeted Analysis Process:
# 1. Focus on Components/Elements Section: Review the 2 elements starting with: Component organization: Set up directory structure for components
# 2. Examine Implementation at: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\components` with pattern P002-SERVER-COMPONENT, P003-CLIENT-COMPONENT
# 3. Review Legacy References: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components:1-5` for component directory structure
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\home-4:1-5` for feature-specific components
# 4. Classify Testing Approach: Determine the most appropriate testing strategy for each element type
# 5. Output structured findings to pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-discovery.md

# Element Classification Logic:
# - React Components: 
#   - Server Components (non-interactive): Render testing, props validation, server-side behavior
#   - Client Components (interactive): User interaction testing, state management, event handling
# - Utility Functions: Unit testing for input/output, edge cases, type safety
# - Infrastructure Elements: 
#   - loading.tsx/error.tsx: Error simulation, loading state validation
#   - Route handlers: Request/response testing, error handling
# - Type Definitions: Type checking, interface compliance testing
# - Design System Elements: Component variant testing, design token validation

# Required Output Format for current-test-discovery.md:
# ## Testable Elements Discovery
# 
# ### React Components
# - ComponentName1 (Server Component): Description of component purpose and testing focus
# - ComponentName2 (Client Component): Description of interactive features requiring testing
# 
# ### Utility Functions  
# - UtilityFunction1: Description of function purpose and testing requirements
# - UtilityFunction2: Description of expected inputs/outputs and edge cases
# 
# ### Infrastructure Elements
# - loading.tsx: Loading state validation requirements
# - error.tsx: Error handling scenarios to test
# 
# ### Type Definitions
# - InterfaceName: Type safety and compliance testing requirements
# 
# ### Testing Priority Classification
# - High Priority: Critical user-facing elements requiring comprehensive testing
# - Medium Priority: Supporting elements requiring basic validation  
# - Low Priority: Type definitions and simple utilities requiring minimal testing

## Success Criteria & Quality Gates

### Component Implementation Requirements
- **T-1.3.2:ELE-1 (Server)**: Proper server component with no client directive, Server component defaults: Implement server-first component approach, blue boundary
- **T-1.3.2:ELE-2 (Client)**: Proper client component with 'use client' directive present, Client component boundaries: Define explicit client boundaries for interactive elements, green boundary

### Testing Quality Gates
- **Phase 0**: Environment setup complete, all dependencies verified
- **Phase 1**: Component discovery complete, scaffolds generated with real content
- **Phase 2**: Unit tests pass, component classification validated
- **Phase 3**: High-quality screenshots captured, visual boundaries visible
- **Phase 4**: LLM Vision analysis ≥ 95% confidence for all components
- **Phase 5**: Complete testing documentation and human-readable reports

### Final Acceptance Criteria
- Server components are implemented by default for non-interactive components
- Client components are explicitly marked with 'use client' directive
- Composition patterns optimize client/server boundaries
- Data fetching is isolated to server components

## Human Verification

### Review Locations
- **Enhanced Scaffolds**: `test/scaffolds/T-1.3.2/` - Real React rendering with boundaries
- **Screenshots**: `test/screenshots/T-1.3.2/` - Visual component validation
- **LLM Vision Reports**: `test/screenshots/T-1.3.2/*-enhanced-analysis.md` - AI analysis
- **Testing Report**: `test/reports/T-1.3.2-testing-report.md` - Complete summary

### Manual Validation Steps
1. Open enhanced scaffolds in browser to verify real React content
2. Review screenshots for proper Tailwind CSS styling and boundaries
3. Read LLM Vision analysis reports for confidence scores and feedback
4. Confirm all components meet T-1.3.2 acceptance criteria
5. Validate server/client classification through visual boundaries

### Completion Checklist
- [ ] All testing phases executed successfully
- [ ] 2 T-1.3.2 components validated through Enhanced LLM Vision analysis
- [ ] Visual boundaries clearly distinguish server (blue) vs client (green) components
- [ ] Testing artifacts complete and accessible
- [ ] Human verification confirms quality and requirements satisfaction
