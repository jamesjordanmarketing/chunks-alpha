## Design System Adherence Protocol (DSAP)

**MANDATORY REQUIREMENT**: IF this task involves design, component, token, or animation implementation, you MUST follow the Design System Adherence Protocol.

**Design System Documentation Location**: `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/`

### DSAP Compliance Process

**STEP 1: Documentation Discovery** (PREP Phase)
Search ALL relevant documentation categories:

**Components** (`/components/`):
- `/core/` - buttons.md, cards.md, inputs.md, component-states.md
- `/interactive/` - accordion/, modals/, dropdowns/ (component-specific folders)
- `/navigation/` - nav bars, menus, breadcrumbs
- `/sections/` - page sections, layouts, containers

**Animations** (`/animations/`):
- `/interactive/` - hover-animations.md, focus-animations.md, touch-interactions.md, state-transitions.md
- `/entry-exit/` - page/component mount/unmount animations
- `/timing/` - duration, easing, performance standards
- `/accessibility/` - reduced motion, animation accessibility

**Responsive Design** (`/responsive/`):
- `/breakpoints/` - screen size definitions and usage
- `/typography/` - responsive text scaling
- `/layouts/` - grid systems, spacing
- `/components/` - component responsive behavior

**Architecture** (`/architecture/`):
- `component-hierarchy.md` - component relationships
- `design-system-consistency.md` - visual consistency rules
- `cross-component-styling.md` - shared styling patterns

**STEP 2: Compliance Implementation** (IMP Phase)
- Follow ALL discovered documentation standards
- For missing documentation: implement best practices and document decisions
- Reference specific documentation files in implementation comments

**STEP 3: Adherence Reporting** (VAL Phase)
Create compliance report at: `aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-{series}/T-2.5.3/design-system-adherence-report.md`

**Missing Documentation Protocol**:
- Continue with implementation using best practices
- Document all gaps and agent decisions in adherence report
- Flag gaps for future documentation creation

**FAILURE TO COMPLY**: Implementation without DSAP compliance will be rejected.

## Task Approach

### Current Approach (Added: 06/28/2025, 04:45:16 PM)

Overview:
Create semantic token mapping system that integrates with completed T-2.5.2 theme provider. Build component-specific token aliases, theme-aware CSS custom properties, and token transformation utilities leveraging the 69 validated token paths from T-2.5.1 with automatic light/dark theme resolution. **ENHANCED** with Theme Switcher component foundation to enable T-2.5.3a implementation.

Implementation Strategy:
1. **Create Theme Token Mapping Files**
   - Build light theme mappings in styles/themes/default.ts using T-2.5.1 validated color tokens
   - Create dark theme mappings in styles/themes/dark.ts with appropriate contrast ratios
   - Define semantic token interfaces that map to existing ColorTokenPath, TypographyTokenPath, SpacingTokenPath
   - Ensure mappings integrate with T-2.5.2 useThemeTokens hook interface

2. **Implement Component-Specific Token Aliasing**
   - Create semantic aliases for common components (button, card, input, nav) using meaningful names
   - Map semantic tokens to T-2.5.1 token paths: button-primary-bg → colors.primary.DEFAULT
   - Build token aliasing mechanism that resolves through T-2.5.2 theme context
   - Organize by component type for improved developer experience and tree-shaking
   - **[ENHANCED]** Include Theme Switcher button semantic tokens with cross-theme compatibility

3. **Build Token Value Transformation Utilities**
   - Create utilities for opacity modifications, color state variations, and scaling
   - Implement contrast ratio verification ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across themes
   - Build transformation functions that work with ColorStateVariations from T-2.5.1
   - Ensure utilities integrate with existing theme provider token resolution functions

4. **Generate CSS Custom Properties for Runtime Theme Switching**
   - Create CSS custom property generator that outputs theme-aware variables
   - Build system that updates properties when T-2.5.2 setTheme function is called
   - Generate properties for all semantic tokens with --aplio-* naming convention
   - Ensure seamless integration with Tailwind CSS dark mode and existing class strategies
   - **[ENHANCED]** Implement reactive CSS variables that update automatically on theme context changes

5. **Validate Semantic Token System Integration**
   - Test semantic mappings resolve correctly through T-2.5.2 theme context
   - Verify CSS custom properties update automatically on theme changes
   - Validate component-specific token organization improves developer experience
   - Ensure 95% test coverage including integration tests with T-2.5.2 theme switching
   - **[ENHANCED]** Test Theme Switcher token requirements for upcoming T-2.5.3a implementation

Key Considerations:
• Integrate with T-2.5.2 theme provider hooks - use existing useTheme and useThemeTokens interfaces without modification
• Leverage 69 validated token paths from T-2.5.1 - semantic mappings must resolve to existing ColorTokenPath, TypographyTokenPath, SpacingTokenPath
• Maintain TypeScript strict mode compliance - extend existing token interfaces without breaking T-2.5.2 type safety
• Ensure CSS custom properties work with T-2.5.2 theme switching - properties must update automatically on setTheme calls
• Preserve performance standards from T-2.5.2 - semantic token resolution must not impact theme switching speed
• **[ENHANCED]** Prepare token foundation for Theme Switcher component with proper accessibility and animation support

### Approach History

## Theme Switcher Integration Requirements

### Overview
This task has been enhanced to prepare the token foundation for the upcoming T-2.5.3a Theme Switcher Implementation. The following requirements ensure seamless integration with the planned Theme Switcher component.

### Priority Enhancement 1: Reactive CSS Custom Properties
**Requirement**: CSS custom properties must update automatically when theme context changes via setTheme() calls from the Theme Switcher component.

**Technical Implementation**:
- CSS variables must be reactive to T-2.5.2 theme provider context changes
- Properties should update without page refresh when theme is switched
- Integration with existing theme provider setTheme() function

**Validation Criteria**:
- Test that theme token CSS properties update immediately on theme change
- Verify no page refresh required for theme switching
- Ensure compatibility with T-2.5.2 theme provider architecture

### Priority Enhancement 2: Theme Switcher Button Tokens
**Requirement**: Include semantic token mappings specifically for Theme Switcher button states with cross-theme compatibility.

**Token Requirements**:
- `button-theme-switcher-bg` - Background color that works in both light/dark contexts
- `button-theme-switcher-border` - Border color with appropriate contrast
- `button-theme-switcher-hover` - Hover state with accessibility compliance
- `button-theme-switcher-focus` - Focus state meeting WCAG 2.1 AA standards

**Design Constraints**:
- Button must have high contrast in both themes for accessibility
- Neutral colors that provide visual distinction without overpowering
- Consistency with overall design system color palette

### Priority Enhancement 3: Animation Token Support
**Requirement**: Ensure transition duration tokens support Theme Switcher animations.

**Animation Token Requirements**:
- `transition-theme-switch: 200ms ease-in-out` - Main theme transition timing
- `transition-icon-swap: 150ms ease-in-out` - Icon transition timing
- Support for smooth visual transitions between themes

**Integration Points**:
- These tokens will be used in Theme Switcher CSS classes
- Must integrate with existing animation token system
- Performance considerations for 60fps animations

### Priority Enhancement 4: Focus Ring Token Requirements
**Requirement**: Implement WCAG 2.1 AA compliant focus indicators for Theme Switcher keyboard navigation.

**Accessibility Requirements**:
- Minimum 2px offset outline in primary color
- Visible focus states in both light and dark themes
- Keyboard navigation support with clear visual indicators

**Cross-Theme Compatibility**:
- Focus ring must be visible and accessible in both themes
- Proper contrast ratios maintained across theme switches
- Integration with existing focus management patterns

### Implementation Quality Benefits
These enhancements will enable Theme Switcher implementation to be:
- **More Reliable**: CSS properties automatically update on theme changes
- **Less Prone to Defects**: Semantic tokens prevent manual color calculations
- **Easier to Implement**: Pre-defined button and animation tokens available
- **Higher Quality**: Built-in accessibility token support from foundation level

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.

- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.5.3 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that you are following the explicit path set for you in this file:
1. Read the active-task.md file to refresh context
2. Return back to what you were doing if it is contributing to the current task
3. If you are working on code that does not contribute to the current task, send a high priority alert to the human operator

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that your current approach to the task is valid you MUST read the Task Approach section of the current active-task.md:
1. If the approach is still valid, continue coding
2. If the approach has new context or details, add an **Addendum** to the Task Approach
3. If the approach has proven to be erroneous, add a **Major Approach Update** with detailed explanation

New bash shells ALWAYS open in pmc by default. Navigate accordingly when you start a new shell

We have been having some problems with bash terminals hanging on commands. To fix this append ` | cat` to all bash commands. The cat command reads all input and then terminates cleanly when the input stream closes. This ensures the command pipeline has a definitive end point.
