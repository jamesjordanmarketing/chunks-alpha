## Acceptance Criteria
To successfully complete this task, you must:

- Extract typography scale with font families, sizes, weights, and line heights
- Document typography modifiers like letter spacing and text transforms
- Implement type-safe typography token definitions using TypeScript
- Define responsive typography variations for different breakpoints

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach

### Current Approach (Added: 06/14/2025, 11:03:07 PM)

Overview:
Extract comprehensive typography system from legacy SCSS to TypeScript tokens. Implement responsive font scales, modifiers, and type-safe definitions following the successful T-2.1.1 color token pattern. Focus on Next.js 14 optimization and maintaining visual fidelity with the legacy Aplio Design System.

Implementation Strategy:
1. **Legacy Analysis & Font System Extraction**
   - Analyze `_typography.scss` for font families (Inter, Playfair Display, Plus Jakarta Sans)
   - Extract responsive heading scales (h1: 36px/64px, h2: 32px/36px, etc.)
   - Document precise font weights (100-900 for Inter/Jakarta, 600 for Playfair)
   - Map line heights and tracking values from legacy implementations

2. **TypeScript Token Structure Design**
   - Create interfaces following `colors.ts` pattern (FontToken, TypographyScale, etc.)
   - Define responsive breakpoint system for font sizing
   - Structure font family definitions with proper fallbacks
   - Implement modifier tokens for letter spacing, text transforms

3. **Typography Token Implementation**
   - Create `typography.ts` with font family constants and Google Fonts URLs
   - Implement responsive font size scales with precise px values
   - Extract and implement font weight definitions (normal, medium, semibold, bold)
   - Define line height scales and letter spacing modifiers

4. **Type Safety & Export Structure**
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for all typography tokens
   - Implement type-safe exports matching color token pattern
   - Add utility functions for responsive typography access
   - Ensure proper `as const` assertions for type inference

5. **Integration & Validation**
   - Validate extracted typography matches legacy visual output exactly
   - Test responsive breakpoint behavior at different viewport sizes
   - Verify TypeScript compilation and import/export functionality
   - Confirm Next.js 14 compatibility and tree-shaking optimization

Key Considerations:
- **Visual Fidelity**: Typography must match legacy system exactly - all font sizes, weights, and spacing preserved
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: xl: prefix indicates 1280px+ breakpoint, must implement responsive scaling correctly
- **TypeScript Compilation**: Watch for duplicate export issues experienced in T-2.1.1 color system
- **Font Loading Strategy**: Google Fonts import URL must be preserved for Inter, Playfair, Jakarta Sans families
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensure proper tree-shaking support and minimal bundle impact in Next.js 14

### Approach History

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Analyze legacy typography definitions in _typography.scss and tailwind.config.js (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Identify all typography usage patterns and modifiers in the legacy codebase (implements ELE-2)
3. [PREP-3] Study responsive typography implementations in the legacy code (implements ELE-3)
4. [PREP-4] Plan TypeScript structure for typography token definitions (implements ELE-4)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.1.2 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create typography.ts file with font family definitions as TypeScript constants (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Extract and document font size scale with precise values (implements ELE-1)
3. [IMP-3] Extract and document font weight and line height scales (implements ELE-1)
4. [IMP-4] Document and implement letter spacing, text transform, and other typography modifiers (implements ELE-2)
5. [IMP-5] Implement responsive typography variations for different breakpoints (implements ELE-3)
6. [IMP-6] Create TypeScript interfaces and types for typography tokens (implements ELE-4)
7. [IMP-7] Create type-safe exports for all typography tokens (implements ELE-4)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.1.2 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Compare extracted typography with legacy implementation for visual accuracy (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Verify all typography modifiers are properly documented and implemented (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Test responsive typography variations at different viewport sizes (validates ELE-3)
4. [VAL-4] Validate type definitions for typography tokens (validates ELE-4)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.1.2 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.
