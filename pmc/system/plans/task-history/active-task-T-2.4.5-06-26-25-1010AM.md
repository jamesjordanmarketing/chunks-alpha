## Task Approach

### Current Approach (Added: 06/26/2025, 12:28:57 AM)

Overview:
Implement comprehensive accessibility documentation for design system animations using WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards. Create reduced motion alternatives, motion preference detection guides, and accessibility impact assessments that build upon T-2.3.4's timing specifications while addressing the gap in motion sensitivity considerations.

Implementation Strategy:
1. **Preparation Phase - Legacy Analysis & Standards Research**
   - Analyze existing animations in `aplio-legacy/data/animation.js` (fadeUp, fadeFromLeft/Right patterns)
   - Research WCAG 2.1 Level AA motion requirements and CSS `prefers-reduced-motion` implementation
   - Study accessibility impact on users with vestibular disorders, ADHD, and seizure sensitivity
   - Document current gaps between legacy animations and accessibility standards

2. **Documentation Architecture - 5-File Structure Pattern**  
   - Follow T-2.3.4's successful documentation pattern: Overview, Detailed Guide, Quick Reference, Examples, Testing
   - Create `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/accessibility/` directory structure
   - Establish cross-references to T-2.3.4 timing docs for timing-based accessibility alternatives
   - Include dark mode accessibility considerations as core requirement from start

3. **Reduced Motion Implementation Documentation**
   - Document reduced motion alternatives for fadeUp, fadeFromLeft, and fadeFromRight animations
   - Create CSS and JavaScript motion preference detection techniques using `prefers-reduced-motion`
   - Establish guidelines for opacity-only alternatives versus complete motion removal
   - Include Framer Motion specific implementation patterns with accessibility variants

4. **Accessibility Guidelines & Impact Assessment**
   - Document best practices for animation accessibility across different user needs
   - Create practical assessment methods for evaluating animation accessibility impact
   - Establish testing protocols for accessibility compliance verification
   - Include assistive technology compatibility guidelines

5. **Validation & Integration Testing**
   - Validate all documentation against WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
   - Test motion preference detection techniques across browsers and devices
   - Verify integration with T-2.3.4 timing specifications for consistency
   - Ensure TypeScript strict mode compliance for all code examples

Key Considerations:
- **Legacy Integration**: Must maintain 100% accuracy when referencing existing animation patterns from `animation.js`
- **WCAG 2.1 Level AA Compliance**: All recommendations must meet accessibility standards for motion-based content
- **Cross-Task Dependencies**: Documentation must seamlessly reference T-2.3.4 timing specifications
- **Dark Mode Accessibility**: Include dark mode motion considerations as core requirement, not afterthought
- **TypeScript Compliance**: All code examples must compile successfully with strict mode enabled

### Approach History

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Analyze touch interaction patterns in the legacy codebase (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Study touch target size requirements and best practices (implements ELE-2)
3. [PREP-3] Identify hover alternatives for touch devices (implements ELE-3)
4. [PREP-4] Research accessibility considerations for responsive design (implements ELE-4)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.4.5 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Document touch interaction patterns for mobile and tablet devices (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Document touch target size requirements with visual references (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Document mobile-specific hover alternatives for interactive elements (implements ELE-3)
4. [IMP-4] Document accessibility considerations for responsive design (implements ELE-4)
5. [IMP-5] Create visual reference documentation for touch interactions (implements ELE-1, ELE-2, ELE-3)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.4.5 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify touch interaction documentation against legacy implementation (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Verify touch target size documentation meets accessibility standards (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Test hover alternative documentation on touch devices (validates ELE-3)
4. [VAL-4] Validate responsive accessibility documentation against standards (validates ELE-4)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.4.5 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that you are following the explicit path set for you in this file:
1. Read the active-task.md file to refresh context
2. Return back to what you were doing if it is contributing to the current task
3. If you are working on code that does not contribute to the current task, send a high priority alert to the human operator

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that your current approach to the task is valid you MUST read the Task Approach section of the current active-task.md:
1. If the approach is still valid, continue coding
2. If the approach has new context or details, add an **Addendum** to the Task Approach
3. If the approach has proven to be erroneous, add a **Major Approach Update** with detailed explanation

New bash shells ALWAYS open in pmc by default. Navigate accordingly when you start a new shell

We have been having some problems with bash terminals hanging on commands. To fix this append ` | cat` to all bash commands. The cat command reads all input and then terminates cleanly when the input stream closes. This ensures the command pipeline has a definitive end point.
