## Acceptance Criteria
To successfully complete this task, you must:

- Server components are implemented by default for non-interactive components
- Client components are explicitly marked with 'use client' directive
- Composition patterns optimize client/server boundaries
- Data fetching is isolated to server components

These criteria define successful completion of this task and should guide your implementation work through all phases.

## Task Approach
<!-- After reading the task requirements, describe your implementation approach here -->
(To be filled in by the coding agent)

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-1.3.2:ELE-1] Server component defaults: Implement server-first component approach
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\app\home-4\page.jsx:1-30` for page component structure

### [T-1.3.2:ELE-2] Client component boundaries: Define explicit client boundaries for interactive elements
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\components\shared\FaqItem.jsx:1-15` for interactive component

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Analyze server vs. client component requirements (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
2. [PREP-2] Create component boundary diagrams (implements ELE-2)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.3.2 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Create base server component template (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Implement client component wrapper pattern (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Create composition patterns for server/client boundaries (implements ELE-1, ELE-2)
4. [IMP-4] Set up data fetching patterns for server components (implements ELE-1)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.3.2 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Test server component rendering (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Verify client component hydration (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Test composition patterns across boundaries (validates ELE-1, ELE-2)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-1.3.2 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

## Testing Overview
Testing for this task is managed in a separate file to reduce cognitive load and ensure comprehensive test implementation.
See test mapping file: `**Test Locations**: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-modern-1\test\unit-tests\task-1-3\T-1.3.2\`

## Recent Actions
Every 500 output tokens you MUST call:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js log-action "<current task description>" <confidence 1-10>
```

You can also call this command at other times if it will help record context that may be useful while coding this task.

## Notes
You may add implementation notes at any time by calling:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-notes "<your implementation notes>"
```

## Errors Encountered
If you encounter any errors, you MUST report them by calling:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
```
If you have tried to fix an error 5 times and have not made any progress, you MUST call the error command, alert the human operator, and stop coding.

### New Dependencies
When implementing this task, if you identify a dependency requirement that meets BOTH criteria:
1. Not documented in the Task Information section
2. Not already implemented in the codebase

You MUST document this dependency by executing:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js log-dependency "[task-id]" "[detailed dependency specification]"
```
Your dependency specification should include:
- What the dependency is (library, component, service, etc.)

After logging the dependency, paste the command output here and await human operator guidance before proceeding with implementation that relies on this dependency.

### Improvement Suggestions
During implementation, if you identify potential improvements that would enhance:
- Code quality or maintainability
- System flexibility or extensibility
- Feature capabilities or user experience
- Performance or security characteristics

You MUST document these insights by executing:
```
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js log-improvement "[task-id]" "[improvement specification]"
```
Your improvement specification should:
- Clearly articulate the proposed enhancement
- Provide a technical rationale for the suggestion
- Indicate the scope of impact (localized or system-wide)
- Note whether the improvement is critical or could be implemented later

After logging the improvement, paste the command output here, notify the human operator, and continue with your current task implementation.
