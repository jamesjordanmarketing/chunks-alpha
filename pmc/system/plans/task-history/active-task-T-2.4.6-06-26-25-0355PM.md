## Task Approach

### Current Approach (Added: 06/26/2025, 10:26:07 AM)

Overview:
Implement comprehensive responsive typography documentation following the proven T-2.4.5 5-file pattern (~109KB total). Extract typography patterns from legacy `_typography.scss:16-31`, creating WCAG 2.1 AA compliant documentation for responsive font sizing, typographic scale, line height adjustments, and fluid typography implementation across all breakpoints.

Implementation Strategy:
1. **Legacy Typography Pattern Analysis (PREP Phase)**
   - Extract responsive font sizing patterns from `aplio-legacy/scss/_typography.scss` lines 16-31
   - Analyze typographic hierarchy scaling across xl: breakpoint (h1: 36px→64px, h2: 32px→36px, h3: 22px→24px)
   - Study line height adjustments and responsive behavior patterns
   - Research modern fluid typography techniques using CSS `clamp()` and viewport units

2. **5-File Typography Documentation Structure Implementation (IMP Phase)** 
   - Create `typography-definitions.md` (~20-25KB) - Core typography patterns with TypeScript interfaces and responsive scaling definitions
   - Create `typography-implementation-guidelines.md` (~25-30KB) - Comprehensive implementation patterns, code examples, and Next.js 14 integration
   - Create `typography-constraints-specifications.md` (~15-20KB) - Technical constraints, performance specifications, and accessibility requirements
   - Create `typography-testing-guide.md` (~10-15KB) - Testing strategies, validation protocols, and responsive behavior verification
   - Create `typography-visual-reference.md` (~20-30KB) - Visual scaling examples, breakpoint demonstrations, and typographic hierarchy charts

3. **WCAG 2.1 AA Typography Accessibility Documentation**
   - Document minimum font sizes for accessibility compliance (16px base minimum)
   - Create dyslexia-friendly typography considerations and high contrast requirements
   - Establish reading distance and viewport scaling documentation
   - Document screen reader compatibility and focus indicator typography standards

4. **Cross-Reference Integration with Responsive Framework**
   - Link to T-2.4.2 layouts for typography-responsive layout integration
   - Link to T-2.4.5 touch documentation for typography touch target considerations
   - Reference existing breakpoint system for consistent responsive behavior
   - Establish typography-component interaction patterns

5. **Production Validation Protocol (VAL Phase)**
   - Validate 100% accuracy to legacy typography implementation patterns in `_typography.scss:16-31`
   - Test TypeScript strict mode compilation for all typography code examples
   - Verify WCAG 2.1 AA compliance through accessibility testing tools for typography
   - Execute comprehensive validation protocol matching T-2.4.5 certification standards

Key Considerations:
- **T-2.4.5 Pattern Replication**: Must exactly replicate the proven 5-file structure that achieved 109KB comprehensive coverage
- **Legacy Reference Accuracy**: Critical 100% accuracy to typography patterns in `_typography.scss:16-31` with exact line references
- **Fluid Typography Focus**: Document modern CSS techniques like `clamp()` for scalable typography systems
- **Performance Requirements**: Font loading optimization, CLS prevention, and rendering performance considerations
- **Comprehensive Scope**: Target 80-120KB total documentation following T-2.4.5 success pattern

### Approach History

## Task Development Work Pad

As you work on this task, you may use the dedicated work pad file at:
`C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\pmc\core\task-work-pad-dev.md`

This work pad is your thinking space where you can:
- Work through complex implementation approaches
- Document decisions you're making and why
- Keep track of issues to revisit later
- Break down challenging problems into steps
- Test code snippets before final implementation
- Track progress across multiple components

Using this work pad is entirely optional but encouraged for complex tasks where external thinking would be beneficial. Nothing written there will be evaluated as final code - it's purely to assist your development process.

When using the work pad, start each new entry with a timestamp and brief context header to keep your thoughts organized.


## Components/Elements
### [T-2.4.6:ELE-1] Font size scaling documentation: Document responsive font size scaling across breakpoints
  Refer to Legacy Code Reference: `C:\Users\james\Master\BrightHub\Build\APSD-runs\aplio-27-a1-c\aplio-legacy\scss\_typography.scss`:16-31 (font size scaling)

### [T-2.4.6:ELE-2] Heading responsive documentation: Document responsive behavior for heading elements

## Implementation Process Phases
### Preparation Phase    
   - PREP Phase guidance: These Preparation Steps highlight key research and analysis activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary goal is to prepare for complete implementation of all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Enhance these steps as needed to ensure comprehensive preparation.

1. [PREP-1] Analyze font size scaling in the legacy codebase (implements ELE-1)
2. [PREP-2] Study heading responsive behavior at different breakpoints (implements ELE-2)
3. [PREP-3] Identify line height adjustments across breakpoints (implements ELE-3)
4. [PREP-4] Research fluid typography implementation techniques (implements ELE-4)

When the Preparation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.4.6 "PREP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Implementation Phase
   - IMP Phase guidance: These Implementation Steps outline core coding activities but aren't exhaustive. Your primary responsibility is to implement code that fulfills all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Extend beyond these steps when necessary to create a complete solution.

1. [IMP-1] Document responsive font size scaling for different text elements (implements ELE-1)
2. [IMP-2] Document heading responsive behavior with visual references (implements ELE-2)
3. [IMP-3] Document line height adjustments at different breakpoints (implements ELE-3)
4. [IMP-4] Document fluid typography implementation techniques for Next.js 14 (implements ELE-4)
5. [IMP-5] Create visual reference documentation for responsive typography (implements ELE-1, ELE-2, ELE-3)

When the Implementation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.4.6 "IMP" "complete"
from the directory pmc

### Validation Phase
   - VAL Phase guidance: These Validation Steps suggest key testing activities but aren't comprehensive. Your ultimate goal is to verify that your implementation meets all requirements in the ## Acceptance Criteria section of this document. Add additional validation steps as needed to ensure complete quality assurance.

1. [VAL-1] Verify font size scaling documentation against legacy implementation (validates ELE-1)
2. [VAL-2] Verify heading responsive documentation at different breakpoints (validates ELE-2)
3. [VAL-3] Test line height adjustment documentation with sample text (validates ELE-3)
4. [VAL-4] Validate fluid typography documentation with implementation examples (validates ELE-4)

Validation Test Failure Strategy:
- Document all validation test failures with error messages and stack traces
- For each validation failure, implement fixes in the corresponding implementation file
- Rerun failed validation tests until they pass
- If a validation test cannot be fixed after 5 attempts, document the issue and proceed only if it doesn't affect critical functionality
- Log all validation test failures using the error command:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "<error description>" <severity 1-10>
  ```
  Example error logs:
  ```
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Type error in button component" 7
  node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js error "Critical performance issue" 9
  ```
When the Validation phase steps are complete you MUST call: 
node bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-phase-stage T-2.4.6 "VAL" "complete"
from the directory pmc

After completing the Validation Phase and submitting the VAL update-phase-stage "complete" command, you MUST stop and await instructions from the human operator.

IMPORTANT OPERATIONAL INSTRUCTIONS:

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that you are following the explicit path set for you in this file:
1. Read the active-task.md file to refresh context
2. Return back to what you were doing if it is contributing to the current task
3. If you are working on code that does not contribute to the current task, send a high priority alert to the human operator

As you code this task if you ever become unsure that your current approach to the task is valid you MUST read the Task Approach section of the current active-task.md:
1. If the approach is still valid, continue coding
2. If the approach has new context or details, add an **Addendum** to the Task Approach
3. If the approach has proven to be erroneous, add a **Major Approach Update** with detailed explanation

New bash shells ALWAYS open in pmc by default. Navigate accordingly when you start a new shell

We have been having some problems with bash terminals hanging on commands. To fix this append ` | cat` to all bash commands. The cat command reads all input and then terminates cleanly when the input stream closes. This ensures the command pipeline has a definitive end point.
