# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-07 22:21 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus
**CRITICAL PRIORITY: T-1.2.4 Implementation (Event and External Library Type Integration)**

The next agent will serve as a **Development Engineer** to implement T-1.2.4 - Event and External Library Type Integration. This task builds directly upon the completed T-1.2.3 type system foundation and requires comprehensive implementation of event handler types and external library type definitions.

**What is being worked on:**
T-1.2.4 implementation involves creating TypeScript type definitions for:
1. Event handlers (T-1.2.4:ELE-1) - React event types, form events, click handlers, etc.
2. External library types (T-1.2.4:ELE-2) - Type definitions for third-party libraries used in the project

**Why it is being worked on:**
- T-1.2.3 (API and Utility Type Definitions) has been successfully completed and validated
- T-1.2.4 is the next sequential task in the type system implementation sequence
- Event types and external library types are essential for React component implementation in subsequent tasks
- This completes the foundational type system before moving to actual component development

**Current state of implementation:**
- T-1.2.3 COMPLETED ✅ - All API and utility types successfully implemented and tested
- T-1.2.4 NOT STARTED ❌ - Ready for implementation
- Type system foundation is robust and ready for extension
- TypeScript strict mode compilation validated for existing types

**Critical context needed for continuation:**
- All T-1.2.3 types are functional and tested (57 type definitions across API and utility types)
- TypeScript configuration is properly set with strict mode enabled
- Path aliases are configured and working (types accessible via `./types/*`)
- Legacy data compatibility has been validated for all API types
- Type organization patterns established in T-1.2.2 and T-1.2.3 should be followed

**Key Implementation Requirements for T-1.2.4:**
- Event handlers must use appropriate TypeScript event types (React.MouseEvent, React.FormEvent, etc.)
- External library types must be properly imported or defined for libraries lacking type definitions
- Type definitions must enhance developer experience with IntelliSense and autocompletion
- Type safety must be maintained across all library integrations
- 90% code coverage requirement for testing

**CRITICAL TESTING CONTEXT FROM T-1.2.3:**
The previous agent conducted comprehensive testing using an adapted testing protocol for type definitions:
- Traditional Jest runtime testing was challenging for type-only definitions
- TypeScript compilation testing proved to be the most effective validation method
- Type safety validation through strict mode compilation was successful
- Legacy data compatibility testing confirmed all API types work with existing JSON structures
- Integration testing validated cross-type compatibility between API and utility types

### Next Steps 
1. **T-1.2.4-PREP-1** - Catalog event handler patterns in legacy code (`aplio-legacy/components/shared/Button.jsx:20-30`)
2. **T-1.2.4-PREP-2** - Identify external libraries requiring type definitions (`aplio-legacy/package.json:10-25`)
3. **T-1.2.4-IMP-1** - Create type definitions for common event handlers (click, submit, change events)
4. **T-1.2.4-IMP-2** - Implement form event type definitions for form components
5. **T-1.2.4-IMP-3** - Install @types packages for external libraries requiring type support

### Important Dependencies
1. **T-1.2.3 Completion Status** - ✅ COMPLETED - All API and utility types implemented and validated
2. **TypeScript Configuration** - ✅ READY - Strict mode enabled, path aliases configured
3. **Testing Infrastructure** - ✅ READY - Jest, TypeScript, ts-node, MSW all installed and configured
4. **Legacy Code References** - ✅ AVAILABLE - Button.jsx and package.json references documented

### Important Files
1. `types/api/index.ts` - Completed API type definitions from T-1.2.3 (reference for patterns)
2. `types/utils/index.ts` - Completed utility type definitions from T-1.2.3 (reference for patterns)
3. `types/index.ts` - Main barrel export file for type organization
4. `pmc/core/active-task.md` - T-1.2.4 task requirements and acceptance criteria
5. `aplio-legacy/components/shared/Button.jsx` - Legacy event handler patterns (lines 20-30)
6. `aplio-legacy/package.json` - External dependencies requiring type definitions (lines 10-25)
7. `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration with strict mode and path aliases
8. `test/reports/T-1.2.3-testing-summary.md` - Comprehensive testing results from T-1.2.3

### Important Scripts, Markdown Files, and Specifications
1. `pmc/core/active-task.md` - Complete T-1.2.4 specifications and requirements
2. `pmc/system/plans/task-approach/current-test-discovery.md` - T-1.2.3 testing approach (reference for T-1.2.4 testing)

  - All 57 type definitions (26 API types, 31 utility types) successfully implemented and validated
  - TypeScript strict mode compilation confirmed with zero errors
  - Legacy data compatibility validated against all existing JSON structures
  - Cross-type integration testing confirmed API and utility types work together
  - Type organization patterns established for consistent implementation
- **Relevant Learnings**: 
  - Type-only code requires adapted testing strategies focusing on TypeScript compilation validation
  - Strict TypeScript mode provides excellent type safety validation
  - Legacy compatibility testing is critical for migration projects
  - Type organization patterns from T-1.2.2 proved effective and should be continued
  - Path alias configuration must match tsconfig.json exactly for proper module resolution
- **Technical Context**:

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
