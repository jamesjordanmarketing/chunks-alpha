# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-05-27 11:49 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

# Phase 6D: COMPLETED - Critical Testing Logic Architecture Fix ✅

## SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION STATUS

**What was worked on**: Phase 6D Critical Testing Logic Architecture Fix - the HIGHEST PRIORITY architectural defect in the system

**Why it was critical**: The testing infrastructure had a fundamentally flawed validation logic that created systematic false positives, making all test results unreliable

**Implementation completed**: 
1. ✅ **CRITICAL LINE 409 FIXED** - Replaced false positive logic with correct validation checking
2. ✅ **Validation functions implemented** - Added infrastructure vs component validation separation  
3. ✅ **Enhanced reporting** - Added false positive detection and accurate reporting
4. ✅ **All critical tests passed** - Validation confirmed the fix is working

**Critical results achieved**:
- **False positive detection successful** - 6 out of 7 components were false positives under old logic
- **True success rate revealed** - 45.5% actual success rate vs. false 100% reported before
- **DashboardStats correctly fails** - Documented false positive case now accurately fails
- **Testing foundation restored** - All future testing now uses reliable validation logic

## NEXT DEVELOPMENT PHASE
With Phase 6D successfully completed, the testing infrastructure is now trustworthy and ready for **Phase 6 Architecture Upgrade continuation** or **component fix implementation** based on the newly accurate test results.

### Current Active Action 
**STATUS**: No active action - Phase 6D completed successfully

### Bugs & Challenges in the Current Task
**STATUS**: No active bugs - Phase 6D critical issue resolved successfully

### Next Steps 

1. **Decision Point**: Choose next development phase based on priorities
   - **Option A**: Continue Phase 6 Architecture Upgrade (6A, 6B, 6C) with corrected validation foundation
   - **Option B**: Fix the 6 components that are now accurately showing as failed
   - **Dependencies**: None - Phase 6D foundation is complete
   - **Expected outcome**: Clear direction for continued development

2. **Component Analysis**: Review detailed failure reasons for the 6 failed components
   - **Action**: Examine validation.issues for Button, DashboardStats, LoginForm, FaqItem, FaqSection, StatChart
   - **Dependencies**: Access to LLM Vision analysis results
   - **Expected outcome**: Understanding of specific component issues

3. **Testing Documentation Update**: Update testing system documentation
   - **Action**: Update `pmc/docs/stm-5a/testing-system-operations-tutorial-v6.md`
   - **Dependencies**: None
   - **Expected outcome**: Documentation reflects corrected validation logic

1. File path from workspace root
2. Purpose/role in current task
3. Current state (if modified)
Only include files directly relevant to current work.]

### Important Scripts, Markdown Files, and Specifications
[CONDITIONAL: Include ONLY if there are specific scripts, documentation, or specs needed for the next steps. Format as:
1. File path from workspace root
2. Purpose/role in current context
3. Key sections to review
Remove section if not directly relevant.]

### Recent Development Context

- **Last Milestone**: Phase 6D Critical Testing Logic Architecture Fix - Successfully eliminated systematic false positives
- **Key Outcomes**: Testing infrastructure now provides accurate validation results (45.5% actual vs 100% false success rate)
- **Relevant Learnings**: False positive detection revealed 6 out of 7 components need fixes; infrastructure vs component validation separation is critical
- **Technical Context**: Corrected validation logic implemented in `aplio-modern-1/test/vision-test-suite.js` with new validation functions available for system-wide use

### Aplio Design System Modernization Project

#### Project Overview
This project aims to transform the existing JavaScript-based Aplio theme into a modern TypeScript-powered Next.js 14 platform. The project specifically focuses on migrating the Home 4 template (https://js-aplio-6.vercel.app/home-4) as the flagship demonstration while preserving Aplio's premium design aesthetics from the existing design system in `/aplio-legacy/`.

#### Key Documents
1. Seed Story: `pmc/product/00-aplio-mod-1-seed-story.md`
2. Project Overview: `pmc/product/00-aplio-mod-1-seed-narrative.md`
3. Raw Data: `pmc/product/_seeds/00-narrative-raw_data-ts-14-v3.md`

#### Project Objectives

##### Primary Goals
1. Migrate Home 4 template to Next.js 14 App Router architecture
2. Preserve exact design elements from `/aplio-legacy/`
3. Implement TypeScript with full type safety
4. Maintain premium design quality and animations

##### Technical Requirements
1. Next.js 14 App Router implementation
2. Complete TypeScript migration
3. Modern component architecture
4. Performance optimization

##### Design Requirements
1. Exact preservation of design elements from `/aplio-legacy/`
2. Maintenance of animation quality
3. Responsive behavior preservation
4. Professional template implementation

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
```bash
node system/management/carryover-command.js
```
