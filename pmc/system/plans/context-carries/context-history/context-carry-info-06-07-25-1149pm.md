# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-07 23:49 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 5.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]
**NEXT IMPLEMENTATION: T-1.3.1 UNIT TESTING PHASE**

**What is being worked on:**
Task T-1.3.1 (Component Directory Structure Setup) has been **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** and all acceptance criteria have been met. The next critical step is comprehensive unit testing to validate the implementation meets all requirements with 90% code coverage using Jest, fs-extra, and Node path module.

**Why it is being worked on:**
T-1.3.1 implementation is complete with all three phases successfully executed:
- **PREP Phase**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Component categorization strategy and inventory created
- **IMP Phase**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Full directory structure and index files implemented
- **VAL Phase**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Directory structure verified and import patterns validated

The implementation requires comprehensive unit testing before certification as complete and ready for T-1.3.2 dependency.

**Current state of implementation:**
- **IMPLEMENTATION STATUS**: ‚úÖ 100% COMPLETE - All acceptance criteria met
- **DIRECTORY STRUCTURE**: ‚úÖ Fully implemented at `aplio-modern-1/components/` 
- **VALIDATION**: ‚úÖ TypeScript compilation successful, import patterns verified
- **TESTING STATUS**: ‚ùå PENDING - Unit tests required for 90% coverage certification
- **TEST LOCATION**: `aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-1-3/T-1.3.1/`
- **TESTING TOOLS**: Jest, fs-extra, Node path module (as specified)

**Critical context for testing continuation:**
The next testing agent needs to understand the comprehensive implementation scope and specific testing requirements:

1. **Complete Implementation Delivered:** 
   - Main directory structure: `components/design-system/`, `components/features/`, `components/shared/`
   - 14 subdirectories with proper categorization
   - 15 index.ts files for clean import patterns
   - TypeScript compilation verified successful

2. **Testing Requirements Analysis Gap:** 
   - Infrastructure task requires specialized testing approach (directory structure vs runtime functionality)
   - 90% code coverage requirement needs interpretation for directory/file structure testing
   - fs-extra and Node path module testing patterns required for directory validation
   - Testing strategy must validate organizational patterns rather than component functionality

3. **Implementation Quality Verification:**
   - All acceptance criteria explicitly satisfied
   - Legacy pattern analysis completed and applied
   - Import pattern validation successful
   - Component categorization strategy documented and applied

4. **Testing Focus Areas:**
   - Directory structure existence and organization
   - Index file functionality and export patterns
   - Import resolution across all component categories
   - Naming convention compliance
   - Component categorization accuracy

Do not deviate from this testing focus without explicit instruction.

### Aplio Design System Modernization Project

#### Project Overview
This project aims to transform the existing JavaScript-based Aplio theme into a modern TypeScript-powered Next.js 14 platform. The project specifically focuses on migrating the Home 4 template (https://js-aplio-6.vercel.app/home-4) as the flagship demonstration while preserving Aplio's premium design aesthetics from the existing design system in `/aplio-legacy/`.

#### Key Documents

#### Project Objectives

##### Primary Goals
1. Migrate Home 4 template to Next.js 14 App Router architecture
2. Preserve exact design elements from `/aplio-legacy/`
3. Implement TypeScript with full type safety
4. Maintain premium design quality and animations

##### Technical Requirements

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
