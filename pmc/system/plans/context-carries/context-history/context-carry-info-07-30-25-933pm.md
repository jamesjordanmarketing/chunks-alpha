# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-07-30 21:33 PST
**Project:** Content Analysis Module Front-End Implementation
**Context Version:** 3.1.0

## Introduction

This context document focuses on the implementation of front-end interfaces for the content analysis module of the LoRA Training Data Pipeline Platform. The project involves creating three interconnected React/TypeScript applications that provide a complete user experience for content upload, analysis, and workflow management.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**Primary Objective:** Engineering the front-end interfaces for the content analysis module as specified in `pmc/product/_front-end/`

**What is being worked on:**
Implementation of three core front-end applications:
1. **Content Upload Interface** (`content-upload/`) - File upload and initial content analysis page
2. **Content Analysis Dashboard** (`content-dash/`) - Comprehensive dashboard for managing and monitoring content analysis
3. **Main Workflow Interface** (`content-main/`) - Primary workflow dashboard showing pipeline progress

**Why it is being worked on:**
These front-end interfaces are essential for providing users with a complete content analysis experience, from initial file upload through the entire LoRA training data pipeline workflow. They represent the primary user touchpoints for the content analysis module.

**Current state of implementation:**
- Component structures are defined with TypeScript interfaces
- Basic React components exist with mock data
- UI component library structure is established
- Design patterns and layouts are specified
- Integration points between modules are identified

**Critical context needed for continuation:**
- All three modules share common components (WorkflowProgressBar, ProjectSidebar, UI components)
- The workflow follows a 6-stage pipeline: Content Analysis → Training Pairs → Semantic Variations → Quality Assessment → Style Adaptation → Dataset Export
- Each module represents different stages/views of the same underlying workflow
- Components use shadcn/ui design system with Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript is required throughout with proper type definitions

### Next Steps

1. **Set up development environment and project structure**
   - Dependencies: Node.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
   - Expected outcome: Functional development environment with all three applications

2. **Implement shared UI component library**
   - Action: Create reusable components in `components/ui/` directories
   - Dependencies: shadcn/ui installation and configuration
   - Expected outcome: Consistent UI components across all three modules

3. **Build Content Upload Interface (content-upload/)**
   - Action: Implement file upload functionality and ContentAnalysisPage component
   - Dependencies: Shared UI components
   - Expected outcome: Functional file upload interface with analysis initiation

4. **Develop Content Analysis Dashboard (content-dash/)**
   - Action: Create ContentAnalysisDashboard and FileAnalysisPage components
   - Dependencies: Content upload interface completion
   - Expected outcome: Comprehensive dashboard for content management and monitoring

5. **Complete Main Workflow Interface (content-main/)**
   - Action: Implement workflow progress tracking and stage management
   - Dependencies: Previous interfaces for context
   - Expected outcome: Complete workflow dashboard with stage navigation

## Implementation Specification

### Technical Requirements

**Framework Stack:**
- React 18+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- shadcn/ui component library
- Lucide React for icons
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript features

**Architecture Patterns:**
- Component-based architecture with reusable UI components
- State management using React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Consistent design system across all modules

**Key Components to Implement:**

1. **Shared Components:**
   - WorkflowProgressBar: 6-stage pipeline progress indicator
   - ProjectSidebar: Project information and recent activity
   - UI Components: Button, Card, Badge, Progress, Select, etc.

2. **Content Upload Module:**
   - ContentAnalysisPage: File upload interface with drag-and-drop
   - File management with upload progress tracking
   - Analysis configuration options

3. **Content Dashboard Module:**
   - ContentAnalysisDashboard: Overview of all uploaded content
   - FileAnalysisPage: Detailed analysis results
   - Content filtering and search capabilities

4. **Main Workflow Module:**
   - StageContent: Dynamic content based on current workflow stage
   - Stage navigation and progress tracking
   - Integration with other modules

### Data Flow and Integration

**Workflow Stages:**
1. Content Analysis (45% progress in upload module)
2. Training Pairs (locked until content analysis complete)
3. Semantic Variations (67% progress in main module)
4. Quality Assessment (locked)
5. Style Adaptation (locked)
6. Dataset Export (locked)

**State Management:**
- Each module maintains its own local state
- Shared data structures for project information
- Mock data provided for development and testing
- Future integration points identified for backend services

**Component Reusability:**
- UI components shared across all modules
- Consistent styling and behavior patterns
- TypeScript interfaces ensure type safety
- Modular architecture supports independent development

### Success Criteria

1. **Functional Requirements:**
   - All three applications render without errors
   - File upload functionality works with proper validation
   - Workflow progress accurately reflects current stage
   - Navigation between stages functions correctly
   - Responsive design works on desktop and mobile

2. **Technical Requirements:**
   - TypeScript compilation without errors
   - Consistent code style and formatting
   - Proper component composition and reusability
   - Performance optimization for large file handling
   - Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

3. **User Experience Requirements:**
   - Intuitive navigation and workflow progression
   - Clear visual feedback for all user actions
   - Consistent design language across all modules
   - Helpful error messages and validation feedback
   - Smooth transitions and loading states

## Project Reference Guide
