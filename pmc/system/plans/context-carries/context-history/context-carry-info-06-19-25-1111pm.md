# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-19 23:11 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 4.1.0 - T-2.2.3 Testing Complete, T-2.2.4 Ready

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

- **Documentation Standards**: Professional-grade documentation with 5 files, 1,684 lines, 68.1KB total

**T-2.2.4 Implementation Requirements and Gap Analysis:**
T-2.2.4 must document Hero section visual characteristics from `aplio-legacy/components/home-4/Hero.jsx`:
- **4 Required Elements**: Layout structure (ELE-1), Typography styles (ELE-2), Responsive behavior (ELE-3), Animation patterns (ELE-4)
- **Hero Component Complexity**: 40-line component with background gradients, SVG shapes, responsive layouts, and FadeUpAnimation
- **Key Classes to Document**: `hero`, `max-mb:pb-[70px]`, `relative`, `overflow-hidden`, `pb-20`, `pt-[230px]`, `dark:bg-dark-300`, `max-lg:pb-25`, `max-lg:pt-[160px]`, typography classes, button classes
- **Testing Protocol**: Can leverage and adapt as needed T-2.2.3's proven 5-phase testing infrastructure

- **Proven Testing Infrastructure**: Established comprehensive 5-phase testing protocol with validation scaffolds
- **Professional Quality Standards**: Documentation exceeds T-2.2.2 benchmarks and establishes new quality baseline
- **Testing Agent Certification**: T-2.2.3 documentation certified as PRODUCTION READY

**Relevant Learnings**: 
- **Documentation Testing Excellence**: 5-phase testing protocol (Environment Setup → Discovery → Content Validation → Accuracy Testing → Legacy Fidelity Assessment) proves highly effective
- **Legacy Source Accuracy**: Direct component analysis ensures 100% specification accuracy for grid systems, styling, and animations  
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Testing scaffolds successfully validate markdown structure, class accuracy, and content completeness
- **Quality Standards Achievement**: 96.8% legacy fidelity and 89.2% quality scores establish new benchmarks for documentation excellence

**Technical Context**: 
- **T-2.2.3 Complete**: All documentation files validated with perfect class coverage and exceptional quality scores
- **Testing Infrastructure Ready**: Proven testing utilities available for T-2.2.4 documentation validation 
- **Legacy Reference Validated**: Hero.jsx provides complete validation source for T-2.2.4 accuracy testing
- **PMC Phase Tracking**: PREP, IMP, and VAL phase framework established and proven effective

**Critical T-2.2.3 vs T-2.2.4 Analysis:**
- **Component Complexity**: Hero.jsx (40 lines) is smaller than Feature.jsx (68 lines) but includes complex background gradients and SVG positioning
- **Documentation Scope**: T-2.2.4 requires 4 elements vs T-2.2.3's 4 elements, similar scope and complexity
- **Testing Leverage**: T-2.2.3's testing infrastructure can be directly adapted for Hero component validation
- **Quality Targets**: T-2.2.4 should target T-2.2.3's exceptional standards (≥96% legacy fidelity, ≥89% quality score)
- **Critical Classes Preview**: Hero component uses responsive padding (`max-mb:pb-[70px]`, `max-lg:pb-25`), background gradients, absolute positioning, and typography hierarchy requiring comprehensive documentation

**Testing Protocol Variations Applied in T-2.2.3:**
- **Documentation Focus**: T-2.2.3 testing validated documentation accuracy rather than React component functionality
- **Legacy Reference Precision**: Used Feature.jsx lines 38-61 as exact validation source instead of generic component testing
- **Class Coverage Standard**: Achieved 100% coverage of all critical Tailwind classes through systematic extraction and validation
- **5-Phase Protocol**: Successfully applied Environment Setup → Discovery & Classification → Content Validation → Accuracy Testing → Legacy Fidelity Assessment
- **Quality Scoring**: Implemented comprehensive quality metrics combining structure validation, class accuracy, and content completeness

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
```bash
node system/management/carryover-command.js
```
