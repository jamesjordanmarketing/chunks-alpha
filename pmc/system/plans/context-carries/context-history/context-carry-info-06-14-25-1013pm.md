# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-14 22:15 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 4.1.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**TRANSITION TO T-2.1.2 IMPLEMENTATION PHASE: Typography System Extraction**

**What is being worked on**: Task T-2.1.2 - Typography System Extraction is ready for implementation. This follows the successful completion of comprehensive testing for T-2.1.1 Color System Extraction, which was validated as production-ready with 100% accuracy and all critical issues resolved.

**Why it is being worked on**: T-2.1.1 Color System Extraction has been **COMPLETELY TESTED AND VALIDATED** through a comprehensive 5-phase testing protocol. The color token system achieved:
- ✅ **100% color accuracy** (18/18 legacy hex values preserved exactly)
- ✅ **100% test coverage** (exceeded 90% requirement) 
- ✅ **Critical TypeScript bug fixed** (export conflicts resolved)
- ✅ **Production approval** granted with full validation documentation
- ✅ **Next.js 14 optimization** confirmed with proper tree-shaking support

T-2.1.2 Typography System Extraction is the logical next step in the design token extraction sequence, building upon the validated color system foundation.

**Current state of implementation**: 
- **T-2.1.1 Status**: ✅ **TESTING COMPLETE & PRODUCTION APPROVED**
  - All 5 testing phases executed successfully (Phase 0-5)
  - Critical TypeScript compilation issue identified and resolved
  - Comprehensive testing documentation generated (5 test artifact files)
  - Color token system ready for use in Next.js 14 implementation
- **T-2.1.2 Status**: **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** - Task initialized and requirements defined
- **Implementation Location**: `aplio-modern-1/styles/design-tokens/typography.ts`
- **Test Location**: `aplio-modern-1/test/unit-tests/task-2-1/T-2.1.2/`

**Critical context needed for T-2.1.2 implementation**:

### T-2.1.1 Testing Session Summary (COMPLETED)

#### Comprehensive Testing Protocol Executed
A specialized **5-Phase Testing Protocol** was successfully adapted and executed for T-2.1.1 Color System Extraction:

**Phase 0: Environment Setup** ✅
- TypeScript 5.8.3 confirmed available
- Test directory structure created: `test/unit-tests/task-2-1/T-2.1.1/`
- Implementation file validated: 274 lines at `aplio-modern-1/styles/design-tokens/colors.ts`

**Phase 1: Discovery & Classification** ✅
- **14 Color Constants** discovered and documented
- **4 TypeScript Interfaces** identified and validated
- **2 Utility Functions** found and tested
- **24 Hex Color Values** extracted for validation
- Discovery documentation: `current-test-discovery-T-2.1.1.md`

**Phase 2: TypeScript Testing** ✅ **CRITICAL BUG FOUND & FIXED**
- **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: TypeScript compilation failed with TS2484 errors
- **ROOT CAUSE**: Duplicate interface exports (lines 265-268 in colors.ts)
- **RESOLUTION APPLIED**: Removed duplicate `export type` declarations, kept `export interface`
- **VALIDATION CONFIRMED**: TypeScript compilation now passes with exit code 0
- **Color Accuracy**: 100% match validation against `aplio-legacy/tailwind.config.js`

**Phase 3: Usage Validation** ✅
- Import/export functionality confirmed
- Color token accessibility validated
- Utility function usage tested
- Next.js 14 compatibility verified

**Phase 4: Coverage & Reporting** ✅
- **100% element coverage achieved** (20/20 elements tested)

- Quality metrics exceeded all targets
- Testing artifacts generated

**Phase 5: Final Validation & Production Approval** ✅
- **PRODUCTION READINESS CONFIRMED**
- All acceptance criteria met
- Zero unresolved critical issues
- Comprehensive final testing report generated

#### Critical Testing Protocol Adaptations Made
**IMPORTANT FOR FUTURE TESTING**: The testing approach was successfully **ADAPTED FROM COMPONENT TESTING TO COLOR TOKEN TESTING** because:

- **T-2.1.1 implemented TypeScript color tokens**, NOT React components
- **NO component rendering or visual testing** was performed
- **Testing focused on**: TypeScript compilation, color accuracy, import/export validation
- **Protocol modifications**: Removed screenshot/visual phases, added color validation phases
- **Success metrics adapted**: TypeScript definition coverage instead of component coverage

This adaptation pattern should be applied to **T-2.1.2 Typography System Extraction** as it will also implement TypeScript tokens, not React components.

### T-2.1.2 Implementation Requirements Analysis

#### Core Implementation Requirements
Based on the active task definition, T-2.1.2 must implement:

**Typography Scale Extraction (ELE-1)**:
- Font families from legacy SCSS definitions
- Font sizes with precise values
- Font weights and line height scales
- Implementation location: `aplio-modern-1/styles/design-tokens/typography.ts`

**Typography Modifiers (ELE-2)**:
- Letter spacing definitions
- Text transform options
- Other typography modifiers from legacy system

**Responsive Typography (ELE-3)**:
- Typography variations for different breakpoints
- Responsive scaling implementations

**TypeScript Type Definitions (ELE-4)**:
- Typography token interfaces and types
- Type-safe exports following T-2.1.1 pattern

#### Critical Legacy References for T-2.1.2
- **Primary Source**: `aplio-legacy/scss/_typography.scss` (lines 1-48 for definitions)
- **Modifiers Source**: `aplio-legacy/scss/_typography.scss` (lines 36-40 for modifiers)
- **Responsive Source**: `aplio-legacy/scss/_typography.scss` (lines 16-31 for responsive)
- **Pattern Reference**: `aplio-modern-1/styles/design-tokens/colors.ts` (for TypeScript structure)

#### Potential Requirements Gaps Identified
**CRITICAL DEPENDENCIES FROM T-2.1.1**:
1. **Color Token Integration**: Typography tokens may need to reference color tokens for text colors
2. **Export Pattern Consistency**: Must follow the same export structure as colors.ts
3. **TypeScript Interface Pattern**: Should extend the interface pattern established in T-2.1.1
4. **Testing Protocol**: Will need the same adapted testing approach for token systems

**LEGACY SYSTEM ANALYSIS REQUIRED**:
1. **SCSS File Review**: The legacy `_typography.scss` file needs comprehensive analysis
2. **Tailwind Config Integration**: Typography definitions may also exist in `tailwind.config.js`
3. **Font Loading Strategy**: Need to understand how fonts are loaded in the legacy system
4. **Component Usage Patterns**: Typography usage in existing components needs analysis

### Next Steps (In Priority Order)

1. **Begin T-2.1.2 Implementation - IMMEDIATE PRIORITY**
   - Execute PREP Phase: Analyze legacy typography definitions in SCSS and Tailwind config
   - Study responsive typography implementations in legacy code
   - Plan TypeScript structure for typography tokens following T-2.1.1 pattern

2. **Apply T-2.1.1 Testing Protocol Pattern to T-2.1.2**
   - Adapt the 5-phase testing protocol for typography tokens
   - Focus on typography accuracy, TypeScript compilation, import/export validation
   - Prepare for typography-specific testing requirements (font loading, responsive breakpoints)

3. **Maintain Design Token System Consistency**
   - Ensure typography tokens integrate properly with color tokens
   - Follow established export patterns and directory structure
   - Maintain TypeScript type safety across the design token system

### Important Files

1. **`aplio-modern-1/styles/design-tokens/colors.ts`** - COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION (274 lines) - **PRODUCTION READY** - Color token system with TypeScript interfaces, exact hex values, and state variations. Critical bug fixed (duplicate exports). Serves as pattern for T-2.1.2 implementation.

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
