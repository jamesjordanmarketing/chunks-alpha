# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-24 22:38 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**T-2.4.1 Breakpoint System Documentation - Final Validation & Certification**

**What is being worked on**: Completing the final validation testing and certification of T-2.4.1 Breakpoint System Documentation. The implementation is 95% complete with 3 critical issues identified and partially resolved during comprehensive testing investigation.

**Why it is being worked on**: T-2.4.1 must achieve **PASS** certification before production deployment. Current status is **FAIL** due to 3 specific technical issues that require resolution to meet all 8 success criteria.

**Current state of implementation**: 
- ✅ **5 documentation files implemented** (2,747 lines total) at `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/responsive/breakpoints/`
- ✅ **5 out of 8 success criteria validated** 
- ✅ **T-2.3.5 integration issue RESOLVED** (accessibility docs found and path corrections applied)
- ⚠️ **3 critical issues requiring final resolution** before certification

**Critical context for continuation**: 
- T-2.3.5 accessibility documentation EXISTS at `design-system/docs/animations/accessibility/` (108KB, 3,073+ lines)
- Container configuration is at lines 17-19 NOT 21-23 in `aplio-legacy/tailwind.config.js`
- TypeScript code extraction failed due to markdown parsing issues
- Comprehensive action plan documented in `pmc/system/plans/new-panels/02-new-task-carry-context-2-4-1-investigation-a.md`

### Current Active Action

**Task ID**: T-2.4.1 Final Validation Completion
**Current Phase**: Validation (Post-Investigation)
**Active Element**: Execute 4-phase completion plan following investigation findings
**Last Recorded Action**: Path corrections applied to `container-width-constraints.md`, comprehensive testing investigation completed, action plan documented

### Next Steps

Strictly follow: `pmc/system/plans/new-panels/02-new-task-carry-context-2-4-1-investigation-a.md` so that you may execute the following phases.

1. **Phase 1: Complete Legacy Reference Updates** (30 minutes)
   - Update testing protocols to reference correct lines 17-19 instead of 21-23
   - Apply cascading updates across 6 files in `pmc/`
   - No blockers, scripts provided in action plan

2. **Phase 2: Fix TypeScript Validation** (60 minutes) 
   - Implement proper markdown-aware TypeScript code extraction
   - Execute strict mode compilation testing on all extracted code
   - Dependency: Clean previous broken extraction files

3. **Phase 3: Execute Final Validation Testing** (45 minutes)
   - Run complete T-2.4.1 testing protocol across all 5 phases
   - Generate updated testing report with PASS certification
   - Dependency: Phases 1 & 2 completed successfully

4. **Phase 4: Final Certification Documentation** (15 minutes)
   - Create handoff documentation for production deployment
   - Update testing report with final PASS status
   - Generate completion certificates

### Important Files

1. `pmc/system/plans/new-panels/02-new-task-carry-context-2-4-1-investigation-a.md` - Complete action plan and investigation findings
2. `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/responsive/breakpoints/container-width-constraints.md` - Modified with path corrections
3. `aplio-modern-1/test/reports/T-2.4.1/T-2.4.1-testing-report.md` - Current testing report showing FAIL status
4. `aplio-legacy/tailwind.config.js` - Legacy reference source (lines 13-17 breakpoints, 17-19 container)
5. `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/animations/accessibility/` - T-2.3.5 integration target (confirmed exists)

### Important Scripts, Markdown Files, and Specifications

1. `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2-enhanced.md` - Enhanced testing protocol (requires line number updates)
2. `pmc/system/plans/new-tests/03-new-test-active-test-2-enhanced-06-24-25-0355PM.md` - Secondary testing protocol (requires updates)
3. `pmc/core/active-task.md` - T-2.4.1 task definition and requirements
4. `aplio-modern-1/test/validation/T-2.4.1/typescript-compilation/` - TypeScript extraction directory (needs cleanup/rework)

### Recent Development Context

- **Last Milestone**: Comprehensive T-2.4.1 testing investigation completed revealing 95% completion status
- **Key Outcomes**: 
  - Discovered T-2.3.5 accessibility documentation exists and is comprehensive
  - Identified exact root causes of 3 critical testing failures  
  - Applied immediate path corrections to resolve cross-reference integration
  - Created detailed 4-phase action plan for completion
- **Relevant Learnings**: 
  - Agent context handoff issues can cause "missing" documentation reports
  - Legacy reference accuracy requires exact line number validation
  - TypeScript extraction from markdown requires proper parsing methods
- **Technical Context**: 
  - Working directory should be `aplio-modern-1/` for execution
  - All path corrections applied to eliminate accessibility integration failures
  - Testing protocols contain outdated line references requiring systematic updates
  - 2.5 hours estimated remaining work to achieve PASS certification

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
```bash
node system/management/carryover-command.js
```
