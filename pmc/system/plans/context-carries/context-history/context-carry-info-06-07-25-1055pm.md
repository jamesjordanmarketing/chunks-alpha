# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-07 22:55 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]
**UNIT TESTING ANALYSIS FOR TASK T-1.2.4**

**What is being worked on:**
Task T-1.2.4 (Event and External Library Type Integration) has been completed with all implementation phases (PREP, IMP, VAL) marked as complete. The next phase requires comprehensive unit testing analysis to identify any gaps between the task requirements and the actual implementation delivered.

**Why it is being worked on:**
The task appears complete with 73 passing tests, but a detailed testing analysis is needed to ensure full compliance with the acceptance criteria and identify any missing coverage areas or implementation gaps before moving to the next task in the sequence.

**Current state of implementation:**
- **COMPLETED**: All 3 phases (PREP, IMP, VAL) marked complete in PMC system
- **COMPLETED**: 73 unit tests created and passing (0 failures)
- **COMPLETED**: Event handler type definitions (100+ types) in `aplio-modern-1/types/events/index.ts`
- **COMPLETED**: Form-specific event types in `aplio-modern-1/types/events/forms.ts`  
- **COMPLETED**: External library type definitions with fallbacks in `aplio-modern-1/types/libs/index.ts`
- **COMPLETED**: Updated main types index with proper exports to avoid conflicts
- **COMPLETED**: TypeScript compilation errors for T-1.2.4 resolved

**Critical context needed for continuation:**
The unit testing engineer needs to analyze whether the implementation fully satisfies all acceptance criteria and task requirements. Key areas for analysis include:

1. **Acceptance Criteria Compliance Analysis:**
   - Event handlers use appropriate TypeScript event types ✓ (appears complete)
   - External library types are properly imported or defined ✓ (appears complete)  
   - Type definitions enhance developer experience ✓ (appears complete)
   - Type safety is maintained across library integrations ✓ (appears complete)

2. **Implementation Requirements Gap Analysis:**
   - Review task requirements vs. delivered implementation
   - Verify test coverage meets 90% requirement specified in task definition
   - Analyze if all external libraries identified in legacy code are properly typed
   - Confirm event patterns from legacy components are fully covered

3. **Integration and Quality Analysis:**
   - Test type definitions work correctly with actual component implementations
   - Verify no breaking changes introduced to existing codebase
   - Confirm fallback type interfaces work when external libraries unavailable

**Deliverable Expected:** Comprehensive analysis report identifying any gaps, missing requirements, or areas needing additional work before T-1.2.4 can be considered fully complete.

3. **Test Coverage Analysis**: Analyze if 90% test coverage requirement is met
   - Dependencies: Test coverage reports and metrics
   - Expected outcome: Coverage assessment and recommendations

4. **Integration Testing Recommendations**: Identify integration test needs
   - Dependencies: Understanding of how types integrate with components
   - Expected outcome: Integration testing strategy recommendations

5. **Task Completion Certification**: Provide final certification for T-1.2.4 completion
   - Dependencies: Completion of previous analysis steps
   - Expected outcome: Go/no-go decision for task completion

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
```bash
node system/management/carryover-command.js
```
