# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-07 23:19 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 4.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### [Active Development Focus]
**NEXT TASK IMPLEMENTATION: T-1.3.1 Component Directory Structure Setup**

**What is being worked on:**
Task T-1.3.1 (Component Directory Structure Setup) needs to be implemented next in the development sequence. This task requires creating a comprehensive component directory structure organized by domain and function, separating UI components from feature components.

**Why it is being worked on:**
T-1.2.4 (Event and External Library Type Integration) has been completed with 100% test success rate (73/73 tests passing). The next logical step in the Aplio modernization is establishing the component architecture foundation before implementing individual components. This directory structure will enable efficient component discovery, reuse, and organization as the project scales.

**Current state of implementation:**
- **COMPLETED**: T-1.2.4 with comprehensive TypeScript type definitions and 100% test coverage
- **READY**: T-1.3.1 task definition loaded and requirements analyzed
- **CURRENT STRUCTURE**: Components currently exist in `app/_components/` (11 component files)
- **REQUIREMENT**: Need to create dedicated `components/` directory with domain-based organization
- **DEPENDENCY**: T-1.1.2 (dependency satisfied)

**Critical context needed for continuation:**
The next development agent needs to understand the component organization requirements gaps identified during testing analysis:

1. **Existing Component Location Gap:** Components are currently in `app/_components/` but T-1.3.1 requires creation of a dedicated `components/` directory structure
2. **Component Categorization Need:** 11 existing components need to be analyzed and properly categorized (UI vs feature components)
3. **Directory Structure Requirements:** Must follow P011-ATOMIC-COMPONENT and P012-COMPOSITE-COMPONENT patterns
4. **Legacy Reference Integration:** Must reference `aplio-legacy/components` for organizational patterns

Do not deviate from this focus without explicit instruction.

### Current Active Action 
**Task ID:** T-1.3.1  
**Task Title:** Component Directory Structure Setup  
**Current Phase:** Ready to start - Preparation phase pending

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
