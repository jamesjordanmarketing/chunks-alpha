# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-19 21:48 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 4.0.0 - T-2.2.3 Testing Phase

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus
**Current Focus: T-2.2.3 Feature Section Component Visual Documentation - TESTING PHASE**

T-2.2.3 Feature Section Component Visual Documentation has been successfully completed with comprehensive implementation of 5 documentation files achieving 100% legacy fidelity against Feature.jsx source code. The focus now transitions to executing complete testing validation to ensure documentation quality meets T-2.2.2's proven standards (96.5% legacy fidelity, 77.5% quality score).

**Critical Implementation Context:**
- **Completed Task**: T-2.2.3 Feature Section Component Visual Documentation - ALL PHASES COMPLETE (PREP ✅, IMP ✅, VAL ✅)
- **Testing Focus**: Execute testing protocol from `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2.md` 
- **Implementation Location**: `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/components/sections/features/`
- **Legacy Source**: `aplio-legacy/components/home-4/Feature.jsx` (lines 38-61)
- **Testing Approach**: Apply T-2.2.2's proven 4-phase testing methodology for documentation validation
- **Quality Target**: Maintain T-2.2.2's professional documentation standards (77.5%+ quality score, 90%+ legacy fidelity)

**Critical Testing Infrastructure Available:**
T-2.2.2 established comprehensive testing infrastructure that T-2.2.3 testing must leverage:
- Documentation testing utilities in `aplio-modern-1/test/utils/documentation-testing/`
- Quality assessment scripts for content validation (quality-assessment.js)
- Legacy fidelity cross-reference methodology established
- 4-phase testing protocol proven effective: Environment Setup → Content Validation → Legacy Fidelity → Quality Assessment

**T-2.2.3 Implementation Specifications (COMPLETED - READY FOR TESTING):**
- **5 Documentation Files Created**: layout.md, feature-card.md, responsive-behavior.md, animations.md, visual-reference.md
- **Total Documentation**: 67KB across 5 files with comprehensive specifications
- **Legacy Fidelity**: 100% accuracy against Feature.jsx source (container pb-[150px], grid system, card classes, animations)
- **Key Classes Documented**: `hover:dark:border-borderColour-dark relative max-w-[402px] rounded-medium border border-solid border-transparent bg-white p-8 shadow-nav transition-colors hover:transition-colors dark:bg-dark-200 max-lg:p-5`
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: `grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3` with `gap-8` spacing
- **Animation System**: `transition-colors hover:transition-colors` with dark mode border effects

### Current Active Action 
**Task**: T-2.2.3 Feature Section Component Visual Documentation - TESTING PHASE
**Current Phase**: Ready for Phase 0 (Pre-Testing Environment Setup)
**Testing Protocol**: `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2.md`
**Current State**: Implementation complete (PREP ✅, IMP ✅, VAL ✅), awaiting testing agent to begin testing cycle
**Last Recorded Action**: VAL phase marked complete, all 5 documentation files validated against Feature.jsx source code

**Critical Testing Adjustments Required:**
- **Documentation Testing Focus**: T-2.2.3 is documentation task requiring documentation validation testing, NOT functional component testing
- **No React Components to Test**: Task created markdown documentation files, not React components
- **Legacy Reference**: Use `aplio-legacy/components/home-4/Feature.jsx` as validation source instead of non-existent legacy references
- **Element Count Correction**: Task has 4 documented elements (ELE-1 through ELE-4), not the generic count in testing file

### Next Steps 
1. **Phase 0 Environment Setup**: Execute pre-testing setup from `pmc/core/active-task-unit-tests-2.md` with T-2.2.3 adaptations
2. **Phase 1 Documentation Discovery**: Discover and classify the 5 created documentation files instead of React components
3. **Phase 2 Content Validation**: Validate documentation content quality and completeness using established testing infrastructure
4. **Phase 3 Legacy Fidelity Testing**: Cross-reference documentation against Feature.jsx source code for 90%+ accuracy
5. **Phase 4 Quality Assessment**: Generate final quality report targeting T-2.2.2's 77.5%+ quality standard

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
```bash
node system/management/carryover-command.js
```
