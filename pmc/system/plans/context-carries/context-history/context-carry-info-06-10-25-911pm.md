# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-10 14:33 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 4.1.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus A: T-1.3.2
We will focus on T-1.3.2 as it is defined in: `pmc\core\active-task.md`


### Recent Development Context

- **Last Milestone**: Completed comprehensive Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis Results Review & Quality Assessment for T-1.3.1 Component Directory Structure Setup
- **Key Outcomes**: 
  - T-1.3.1 achieved 94% production readiness (31 of 33 component states approved)
  - All T-1.3.1 acceptance criteria validated through systematic analysis of 33 Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis reports
  - Generated comprehensive quality assessment report with specific technical recommendations
  - Identified 2 critical component issues requiring fixes (ThemeSwitcher JSX return, DashboardStats Promise handling)
  - Validated Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis infrastructure as highly effective for component validation
- **Relevant Learnings**: 
  - Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis with Claude Sonnet 4 provides excellent component quality assessment
  - Systematic review of analysis reports enables comprehensive production readiness certification
  - Component directory organization by domain and function successfully validated through visual analysis
  - Critical rendering errors can be reliably identified and documented through LLM vision analysis
- **Technical Context**: 
  - T-1.3.1 Component Directory Structure Setup is complete and certified for production
  - Final quality assessment report available at `aplio-modern-1/test/reports/T-1.3.1-Final-Quality-Assessment.md`
  - Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis methodology validated for future use
  - Ready to proceed with next development priorities focused on PMC tooling improvements

### Aplio Design System Modernization Project

#### Project Overview
This project aims to transform the existing JavaScript-based Aplio theme into a modern TypeScript-powered Next.js 14 platform. The project specifically focuses on migrating the Home 4 template (https://js-aplio-6.vercel.app/home-4) as the flagship demonstration while preserving Aplio's premium design aesthetics from the existing design system in `/aplio-legacy/`.

#### Key Documents
1. Seed Story: `pmc/product/00-aplio-mod-1-seed-story.md`
2. Project Overview: `pmc/product/00-aplio-mod-1-seed-narrative.md`
3. Raw Data: `pmc/product/_seeds/00-narrative-raw_data-ts-14-v3.md`

#### Project Objectives

##### Primary Goals
1. Migrate Home 4 template to Next.js 14 App Router architecture
2. Preserve exact design elements from `/aplio-legacy/`
3. Implement TypeScript with full type safety
4. Maintain premium design quality and animations

##### Technical Requirements
1. Next.js 14 App Router implementation
2. Complete TypeScript migration
3. Modern component architecture
4. Performance optimization

##### Design Requirements
1. Exact preservation of design elements from `/aplio-legacy/`
2. Maintenance of animation quality
3. Responsive behavior preservation
4. Professional template implementation

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v3.js` (created when 2 got too large) 
Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```
