# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-19 01:17 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 4.1.0 - Post T-2.2.2 Testing, Pre T-2.2.3 Implementation

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus
**Current Focus: T-2.2.3 Feature Section Component Visual Documentation Implementation**

T-2.2.2 Navigation Component Visual Documentation has been successfully completed with comprehensive testing validation achieving 96.5% legacy fidelity and 77.5% quality score. The focus now transitions to T-2.2.3 Feature Section Component Visual Documentation implementation.

**Critical Implementation Context:**
- **Previous Task**: T-2.2.2 completed successfully with full testing validation
- **Current Task**: T-2.2.3 Feature Section Component Visual Documentation 
- **Implementation Location**: `aplio-modern-1/design-system/docs/components/sections/features/`
- **Legacy Reference**: `aplio-legacy/components/home-4/Feature.jsx` (lines 38-61)
- **Implementation Approach**: Apply T-2.2.2's proven 100% legacy fidelity approach through direct Feature.jsx analysis
- **Quality Standard**: Maintain T-2.2.2's professional documentation standards (77.5%+ quality score)

**Testing Infrastructure Established:**
T-2.2.2 testing created comprehensive testing infrastructure that T-2.2.3 can leverage:
- Documentation testing utilities in `aplio-modern-1/test/utils/documentation-testing/`
- Quality assessment scripts for content validation
- Legacy fidelity cross-reference methodology
- 4-phase testing protocol (Environment Setup, Content Validation, Legacy Fidelity, Quality Assessment)

**T-2.2.3 Requirements to Implement:**
1. Feature section layout structure and grid system documentation
2. Feature card design, spacing, typography, and variants documentation  
3. Responsive behavior and layout changes at different breakpoints
4. Animation patterns, timing, and interaction effects documentation
5. Accessibility requirements for feature sections

### Current Active Action 
**Task**: T-2.2.3 Feature Section Component Visual Documentation
**Phase**: Not Started (Ready for Implementation)
**Current State**: Awaiting next agent to begin PREP phase

- **T-2.2.3:ELE-4**: Feature section animation patterns (entrance animations and hover effects)

### Next Steps 
1. **T-2.2.3 PREP-1**: Analyze feature section components in legacy Feature.jsx (lines 38-61)
2. **T-2.2.3 PREP-2**: Identify responsive behavior at different breakpoints from legacy
3. **T-2.2.3 PREP-3**: Study animation patterns used in feature sections from legacy  
4. **T-2.2.3 PREP-4**: Create documentation template for feature section visual characteristics

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
```bash
node system/management/carryover-command.js
```
