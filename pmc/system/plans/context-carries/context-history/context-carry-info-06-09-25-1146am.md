# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-09 11:46 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 4.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus: T-1.3.1 Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis Results Review & Quality Assessment

**Current Status: 95% Complete - Phase 5 Analysis & Quality Assessment Required**

The testing agent has successfully completed comprehensive Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis for T-1.3.1 Component Directory Structure Setup using Claude Sonnet 4. The Enhanced LLM Vision Analyzer (`aplio-modern-1/test/utils/vision/enhanced-llm-vision-analyzer.js`) processed 33 component screenshots and generated detailed analysis reports for each component state.

**1. What needs to be worked on:**
The next agent must conduct a comprehensive analysis of all Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis results to:
- Evaluate quality and completeness of the T-1.3.1 Component Directory Structure Setup implementation
- Assess whether acceptance criteria have been met based on visual evidence
- Determine testing completion status against requirements
- Provide production readiness certification or identify remaining gaps

**2. Why this analysis is critical:**
To complete the final phase of T-1.3.1 testing and provide definitive assessment of:
- Component implementation quality against task requirements
- Visual validation of acceptance criteria completion  
- Gap analysis for any incomplete testing requirements
- Final production readiness determination

**3. Current state of implementation:**
- ✅ **Enhanced LLM Vision Analysis COMPLETE**: 33 comprehensive analysis reports generated
- ✅ **Claude Sonnet 4 API Integration**: Fully functional with detailed component analysis
- ✅ **High-Quality Analysis Reports**: Average scores of 88%+ standard analysis, 91%+ task analysis
- ✅ **Complete Component Coverage**: All 11 component types analyzed across multiple states
- ⚠️ **Analysis Review PENDING**: Comprehensive review of results against T-1.3.1 requirements needed

**4. Critical context needed for continuation:**

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js task-approach
```

##### Update Element Status
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js update-element-status "T-EXAMPLE.1.2:ELE-1" "Complete"
```

##### Task Completion
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js complete-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.3"
```

##### Context Carryover for New Chat Windows
```bash
node system/management/carryover-command.js
```
