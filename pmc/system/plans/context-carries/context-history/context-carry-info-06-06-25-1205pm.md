# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-06-06 12:05 PST
**Project:** Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1)**: A comprehensive modernization project converting the legacy Aplio Design System to leverage Next.js 14's App Router architecture and TypeScript. The project focuses on the Home-4 template implementation while preserving visual fidelity and enhancing developer experience.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**Current Task**: Unit Testing for T-1.1.5: Layout and Metadata Implementation
**Status**: Implementation Phase Complete - Moving to Unit Testing Phase
**Priority**: High - Critical for project milestone completion

**What is being worked on:**
The next agent must implement comprehensive unit tests for the recently completed T-1.1.5 Layout and Metadata Implementation task. This task successfully migrated the Aplio system from a basic Next.js setup to a sophisticated layout hierarchy with comprehensive metadata management, theme switching, and SEO optimization.

**Why it is being worked on:**
The implementation phase has been completed with 13/13 validation tests passing, but formal unit testing is required to meet the 90% code coverage requirement and ensure production readiness. The unit testing will validate all layout nesting behavior, metadata generation, theme switching functionality, and SEO implementation.

**Current state of implementation:**
- âœ… All implementation phases completed (PREP, IMP, VAL)
- âœ… Layout hierarchy implemented with root, marketing, and auth layouts
- âœ… Comprehensive metadata system with OpenGraph, Twitter Cards, and robots directives
- âœ… Theme switching with legacy font migration (Inter, Jakarta Sans, Playfair Display)
- âœ… SEO optimization with sitemap.ts and robots.ts
- âœ… Utility components (cn.ts, providers.tsx, ThemeSwitcher.tsx)
- âœ… Custom validation script showing 13/13 tests passing
- ðŸŽ¯ **NEXT**: Formal unit testing with Jest, React Testing Library, Lighthouse, and Cheerio

**Critical context needed for continuation:**
The task has specific testing requirements defined in pmc/core/active-task.md requiring Jest, React Testing Library, Lighthouse, and Cheerio with 90% code coverage. The unit test engineer must create comprehensive tests that validate both the layout nesting behavior and metadata generation functionality across all implemented components.

### Current Active Action

**Task ID**: T-1.1.5: Layout and Metadata Implementation
**Current Phase**: Unit Testing Phase (Implementation Complete)
**Active Element**: Preparing comprehensive unit test suite for two main elements:
- T-1.1.5:ELE-1 - Layout implementation: Create nested layouts for optimal code sharing
- T-1.1.5:ELE-2 - Metadata API: Implement metadata for SEO optimization

**Last recorded action**: VAL-2 Complete: All metadata validation tests passed - 13/13 tests successful for layout and metadata implementation (Confidence: 9/10)

**Implementation Accomplishments**:
1. **Root Layout Foundation** (IMP-1 âœ…): Migrated from Geist fonts to legacy fonts, added comprehensive metadata with OpenGraph/Twitter Cards, implemented ThemeSwitcher and Providers
2. **Route Group Architecture** (IMP-2 âœ…): Enhanced marketing layout with shared navigation/footer, enhanced auth layout with proper styling and no-index robots
3. **Metadata Implementation** (IMP-3 âœ…): Comprehensive metadata in root layout with template-based titles
4. **Dynamic Metadata Generation** (IMP-4 âœ…): Enhanced about page metadata, created sitemap.ts and robots.ts

**Files Modified/Created During Implementation**:
- aplio-modern-1/app/layout.tsx (enhanced with legacy fonts and comprehensive metadata)
- aplio-modern-1/app/(marketing)/layout.tsx (shared navigation and footer components)
- aplio-modern-1/app/(auth)/layout.tsx (enhanced styling with no-index robots)
- aplio-modern-1/app/(marketing)/about/page.tsx (comprehensive metadata with OpenGraph/Twitter)
- aplio-modern-1/app/_utils/cn.ts (class name utility function)

**Relevant Learnings**:
- Next.js route groups require careful page.tsx management to avoid conflicts
- Metadata API inheritance works correctly from layouts to pages
- Theme switching requires proper client-side hydration handling
- Legacy font migration requires updating both imports and CSS variables

**Technical Context**:
- Using Next.js 15.3.3 with App Router architecture
- TypeScript configured with strict type checking
- Theme management via next-themes package
- SEO optimization via Next.js metadata API
- Build issues resolved by removing conflicting route group pages

**Implementation Gaps Identified for Testing**:
1. **Route Group Navigation**: No tests exist for navigation between route groups
2. **Theme Persistence**: No tests for theme state persistence across page reloads
3. **Metadata Inheritance**: No tests verifying metadata inheritance from layouts to pages
4. **SEO Validation**: No tests using Lighthouse as specified in requirements
5. **Error Boundary Integration**: Theme switching error handling not tested
6. **Responsive Behavior**: Layout responsiveness not tested
7. **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and focus management not tested for theme switcher

**Testing Strategy Recommendations**:
- Use React Testing Library for component behavior testing
- Implement Cheerio tests for HTML metadata validation
- Create Lighthouse tests for SEO performance validation
- Mock next-themes for theme switching tests
- Test layout rendering in isolation and nested scenarios
- Validate metadata appears correctly in document head

### Project Memory Core (PMC) System

#### Core Functionality
Everything in this section is supporting information only. Do NOT select the current task focus from this section.
PMC is a structured modern software development task management and context retention system built around the the main active task file as its central operational component. PMC is product agnostic. In this instance we are using it to code the Aplio Design System Modernization (aplio-mod-1) system described above. The system provides:

1. **Context Locality**: Instructions and context are kept directly alongside their relevant tasks
2. **Structured Checkpoints**: Regular token-based checks prevent context drift
3. **Directive Approach**: Clear commands and instructions with explicit timing requirements
4. **Task-Centric Documentation**: Single source of truth for task implementation

#### Commands

The driver for most PMC commands are in:
`pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js`

The code for most PMC commands are contained within:
- The original context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager.js`
- The next context manager script: `pmc/system/management/context-manager-v2.js` (created when the original got too large)

Here are some important PMC commands:

##### Start Task
```bash
node pmc/bin/aplio-agent-cli.js start-task "T-EXAMPLE.1.1"
```

##### Add Structured Task Approaches
