# Development Context & Operational Priorities
**Date:** 2025-09-21 15:41 PST
**Project:** Bright Run LoRA Training Data Platform (bmo) & Project Memory Core (PMC)
**Context Version:** 3.0.0

## Introduction

This context document addresses two integrated projects that operate in tandem:

1. **Bright Run LoRA Training Data Platform**: Bright Run is a revolutionary LoRA fine-tuning training data platform that transforms unstructured business knowledge into high-quality training datasets through an intuitive 6-stage workflow. We are creating the first user-friendly solution that enables non-technical domain experts to convert their proprietary knowledge‚Äîtranscripts, documents, and expertise‚Äîinto thousands of semantically diverse training pairs suitable for LoRA model fine-tuning.

### What Problem Does This Product Solve?

Small business owners and domain experts possess invaluable proprietary knowledge‚Äîfrom marketing philosophies to operational processes‚Äîbut face insurmountable barriers in transforming this knowledge into LoRA ready training data.

2. **Project Memory Core (PMC)**: A structured task management and context retention system that manages the development of the Aplio project. PMC provides methodical task tracking, context preservation, and implementation guidance through its command-line interface and document-based workflow.

These projects are deliberately interconnected - PMC requires a real-world development project to refine its capabilities, while Aplio benefits from PMC's structured approach to development. Depending on current priorities, work may focus on either advancing the Aplio Design System implementation or enhancing the PMC tooling itself.

## Current Focus

### Active Development Focus

**Document Categorization System - Database Integration: COMPLETED ‚úÖ**
**Next Phase - Data Storage Investigation: Category Tags & Statement of Belonging**

#### üéâ MAJOR MILESTONE COMPLETED: Full Database Integration

**What Was Just Accomplished:**
We successfully completed the full database integration for the document categorization system. The application now properly saves user workflow choices to the Supabase database after resolving multiple critical issues:

1. **‚úÖ Authentication Loading Issues Fixed** - Eliminated infinite spinning with timeout handling
2. **‚úÖ Environment Variable Configuration** - Proper server-side Supabase credentials configured  
3. **‚úÖ Row Level Security (RLS) Integration** - JWT token properly passed for database operations
4. **‚úÖ Database Constraint Issues Resolved** - Fixed ON CONFLICT specification errors
5. **‚úÖ UUID Validation Implemented** - Comprehensive mock-to-real UUID conversion system
6. **‚úÖ Primary Category Selection Storage Verified** - Confirmed data appearing in `workflow_sessions` table

**Current System State:**
- **Frontend**: Fully functional UI with authentication ‚úÖ
- **Authentication**: Complete user registration/login flow ‚úÖ  
- **API Integration**: Real database operations (no more mock responses) ‚úÖ
- **Database**: All required tables exist with proper schema ‚úÖ
- **Primary Categories**: Successfully saving to `workflow_sessions.selected_category_id` ‚úÖ
- **Deployment**: Working on Vercel with live Supabase integration ‚úÖ

#### üîç NEXT INVESTIGATION TASK: Category Tags & Statement of Belonging Storage

**Current Understanding Gap:**
While we confirmed PRIMARY CATEGORY selections are saving correctly, we need to investigate and verify how/where these additional workflow data points are being stored:

1. **Category Tags (Step C)** - Secondary tag selections from tag dimensions
2. **Statement of Belonging (Step A)** - The belonging rating (1-10 scale)

**Investigation Objectives:**
1. **Verify Statement of Belonging Storage**: Confirm `belonging_rating` field is populated correctly
2. **Examine Category Tags Structure**: Understand how `selected_tags` JSON field stores tag selections  
3. **Validate Tag Dimensions**: Ensure tag dimension relationships are working
4. **Test Complete Workflow Data**: Verify all workflow steps save comprehensive data

### Next Steps 

1. **DATABASE-INSPECT-01: Verify Statement of Belonging Storage**
   - **Action**: Query `workflow_sessions` table to examine `belonging_rating` field population
   - **Method**: Use Supabase Table Editor or SQL query to inspect recent records

   - **Expected Outcome**: Confirm belonging_rating values (1-10) are saving correctly

2. **DATABASE-INSPECT-02: Examine Selected Tags JSON Structure**  
   - **Action**: Investigate `selected_tags` field structure and tag dimension relationships
   - **Method**: Complete full workflow (Steps A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC) and inspect JSON data in database
   - **Dependencies**: Understanding from Step 1
   - **Expected Outcome**: Validate tag selections from Step C are properly structured

3. **WORKFLOW-TEST-01: End-to-End Data Validation**
   - **Action**: Perform complete workflow test and verify all data points save correctly
   - **Method**: Test document selection ‚Üí belonging rating ‚Üí category ‚Üí tags ‚Üí submission
   - **Dependencies**: Database inspection findings
   - **Expected Outcome**: Complete mapping of workflow data to database fields

4. **DATA-ANALYSIS-01: Tag Dimension Relationship Verification**
   - **Action**: Verify tag dimension structure matches expected workflow requirements
   - **Method**: Cross-reference `tag_dimensions`, `tags`, and `selected_tags` data
   - **Dependencies**: Complete workflow test results
   - **Expected Outcome**: Confirm tag system integrity and proper data relationships

### Recent Development Context

- **Last Milestone**: Complete database integration for document categorization system with authentication, API routes, and data persistence
- **Key Outcomes**: 
  - Primary category selections confirmed saving to `workflow_sessions.selected_category_id`
  - Authentication flow working end-to-end with JWT token validation
